Herding and loss aversion in stockmarkets: mediating role of fear ofmissing out (FOMO) inretail investorsShilpi GuptaAmity Business School, Amity University Chhattisgarh, Raipur, India, andMonica ShrivastavaShri Shankaracharya Technical Campus, Bhilai, IndiaAbstractPurpose –The study aims to understand the impact of loss aversion and herding on investment decision ofretail investors. The study further evaluates the mediating role of fear of missing out (FOMO) in retail investorson these relationships.Design/methodology/approach –The study employed questionnaire survey to collect data from retailinvestors of Indian stock market. Total 323 data were collected. The collected data were examined usingSmartPLS. Factor analysis and partial least square structural equation modeling were employed for fulfillingthe objectives of the study.Findings –The results of the study revealed that investment decisions of retail investors are significantlyinfluenced by loss aversion, herd behavior as well as FOMO. Assessing the impact of herd behavior and lossaversion on investment decision in presence and absence of FOMO exposed that FOMO partially mediatesthese relations. The mediation was complementary in nature as the presence of FOMO increased the influenceof loss aversion and herd behavior on retail investor ’s investment decisions.Practical implications –Behavioral predispositions are accountable for numerous irregularities in stockmarkets. Thus, it is quite substantial to realize the stimulus of these partialities on investment decisions. Theoutcomes of this study would help financial planners and investors to keep in mind the different ways theirdecision outcomes could be biased and try to ignore them.Originality/value –Though there have been many studies conducted on behavioral biases and their impacton investment decisions, there are very few studies that have taken into account the FOMO factor ininvestment, in context of the behavioral biases. Theoretically, FOMO has been linked with herd behavior andgreed of earning more, but there are very few empirical supports to this fact. Thus, this study is an attempt tofill this gap by examining the role of FOMO on investment decisions and the different biases associated with it.Keywords Herd behavior, Loss aversion, Fear of missing out (FOMO), Retail investorsPaper type Research paperIntroductionFinancial decisions are an essential and indispensable chunk of a family ’s fiscal managementpractices. Choices relating to same have a great impact on the financial fulfilment, satisfactionand enhancement of quality of life of a family ( Sahi et al., 2013 ). But how an investor settle ontheir investment choices and decisions is of critical concern, especially the role of investor ’spartialities and biases that influence their investment decisions ( Olsen, 2007 ;Pompian, 2008 ).Investors tend to underreact as well as overreact to it, in terms of their returns frominvestment as well as market anomalies ( Fama, 1998 ). Due to this the topic has always gainedthe interest of the researchers. There are many studies in the past which have assessedthe impact of two important behavioral biases: loss aversion and herd behavior on theinvestment decision of the investor. However, it has also been observed, in general, that thedecision making of the consumers in general is affected by the fear of missing out (FOMO).Since the investment decisions affect the financial condition of the family, investors aremore concerned about possible losses they could incur. Which has been termed as lossIJOEM17,71720The current issue and full text archive of this journal is available on Emerald Insight at:https://www.emerald.com/insight/1746-8809.htmReceived 14 August 2020Revised 18 December 202010 May 202123 September 2021Accepted 10 November 2021International Journal of EmergingMarketsVol. 17 No. 7, 2022pp. 1720-1737© Emerald Publishing Limited1746-8809DOI10.1108/IJOEM-08-2020-093

	aversion in the prospect theory ( Barberis et al., 2003 ). They tend to sell winning stocks to earnhigher profits in fear of prices coming down in future ( Dar and Hakeem, 2015 ). Thisphenomenon is limited not only to individual stocks but also to investors using mutual fundsto invest in equity market, instead of directly investing in stocks, who are also prone to thesebiases ( Bailey et al. , 2011 ). Also, many a times the investor start following what otherinvestors are doing with an intention of not losing out on things called as herding. In herdbehavior, investors rely on publicly shared evidence more than private information. Investorsbase their decision on masses ’choices of trading in stocks, against relying on their ownrational decisions based on statistics ( Caparrelli et al., 2004 ). Following what the others aredoing with an anxiety of being left out or loss on the race is what is being called as FOMO.Hodkinson (2019) andDogan (2019) explains FOMO as a well-established and embeddedconcept in consumers that leads them to believe they are missing out on an opportunity orevent that others are not.The decision making of the consumers in general is affected by the FOMO and due to this,they tend to follow the herd behavior ( Kang et al., 2019 ). Some consumers also follow herdbehavior for their longing of reducing losses and increasing profits ( Puaschunder, 2018 ). Oneof the main reasons behind experiencing FOMO is a desire to constantly be connected and onsame level as others ( Dogan, 2019 ). According to Denison (2018) , FOMO often routesconsumers toward irrational decisions. Consumers exhibiting FOMO always try to ensurethey are at par with others around them, economically and socially.Looking at FOMO in finance in a holistic manner, one could identify the reason for a surgein number of retail investors in the market. Hershfield (2020) underpinned FOMO as the majorreason behind this surge, even when market movement is uncertain. A frenzied market hasbeen developed, characterized by individuals who are afraid of missing out on potentialopportunities by not being invested in the market ( Morris, 2019 ). Prevalence of FOMO ininvestors leads to a speculative bubble around the market. Evidently, the occurrence ofFOMO is not restricted to equities, but it extends to investment in properties, bitcoin, etc., too(Pichet, 2017 ).When cryptocurrency was introduced, a similar frenzy was developed in the marketwhere everyone wanted to invest in these virtual currencies. Even though most of theinvestors did not even understand what cryptocurrency and blockchain technology is, thebuzz around the subject was more than enough to develop a FOMO on cryptocurrency ’ssuccess and persuade them to blindly invest into it. Wherever consumer behavior is involved,chances of individual developing FOMO are certainly high ( Denison, 2018 ). Human beingshave a desire to stay connected with others around them. In their mind, they are scared if theydo not stay connected to the activities of others around them, they might not have arewarding experience that their peers or relatives are having ( Przybylski et al., 2013 ). Hence,an investor ’s financial decisions too are knowingly or unknowingly influenced bytheir FOMO.Though, there are studies proving the impact of herd behavior and loss aversion towardthe decision making of retail investors ( Baker et al., 2019 ;Sahi et al., 2013 ;Dar and Hakeem,2015). But still no study has taken into consideration the impact of FOMO in exhibiting theherd behavior or loss aversion and then over all decision making of the retail investors.The idea that the decisions of the investors can be affected by the FOMO has not yet gainedthe attention of the researchers. Similarly, to the best of researchers ’knowledge, there is adearth of research, in understanding the role of FOMO in exhibiting the herd behavior andloss aversion by the investors and its effect on investment decision of retail investors
	.Based on the above presented notions, the researchers are trying to find answer to somequestions through this research. First, are herding effect, loss aversion and FOMOsignificantly related to retail investor ’s investment decisions? Second, does the presence ofFOMO change the influence of herd behavior and loss aversion on investment decisions? If so,Herding andloss aversion instock markets1721
	does FOMO mediate the relationship? Partially (complementary or competitive) or fully?Thus, to find answer the above-mentioned questions and to fulfil the identified research gap,the objectives of the study are: (1) To assess the impact of herding, loss aversion and FOMOon retail investor ’s investment decisions, and (2) to evaluate whether, FOMO mediates therelationship of herd behavior and loss aversion with retail investor ’s investment decisions. Inthe present study, the researcher intents to develop an understanding of the influence ofherding effect, FOMO, and loss aversion directly on investment decisions and to examine theinfluence of herding effect and loss aversion on investment decision in the presence of FOMOas mediator. This would sketch a clear picture of the mediating role of FOMO on theserelations.To meet the objective of the study, the paper is divided into four sections. The first sectioncovers the introduction to behavioral partialities, FOMO, investment decisions and thepurpose of the research. The second section encompasses literature review of herding, lossaversion and FOMO along with the hypothesis development for the study. The third sectioncontains the research methodology, data analysis and findings of the study. The fourthsection covers the discussion and implications along with the concluding note, limitationsand future scope of the present study.Literature reviewThere have been numerous theories and models established on these partialities or biases ininvestment decisions: prospect theory by Kahneman and Tversky (2013) that focuses on thedecision taken by investors based on risk prospect, heuristics by Kahneman et al. (1982) thatleads to investors taking decisions under uncertainty, herding effect that leads to investorsdepending on another investor ’s decision more than their own ( Dar and Hakeem, 2015 ) etc.The focus of this study is on loss aversion and herd behavior that influence the retailinvestor ’s investment decisions. Loss aversion is a phenomenon in prospect theory, whereinvestors ’attention is more avoiding losses than earning a gain, even if the risk is of equalmagnitude ( Barberis et al., 2003 ). While herding has been defined as investor ’s tendency tobase their investment decisions on their friends, peers or relative ’s investment decisions,instead of their own market analysis ( Caparrelli et al., 2004 ).Conceptual modelThe conceptual model considers three major constructs that have a direct or indirect impacton the decision-making process of retail investors. These constructs are loss aversion, herdbehavior and FOMO. The studies conducted in the past are discussed below.Loss aversion and investment decisionKahneman and Tversky (1979) in their study related investor behavior and decisions toindividual ’s tendency of avoiding decisions that may provide good return but carry somerisk. When comparing possible losses and gains from an investment, investors tend to be lesspositive about the possible gains and are much more afraid of the prospect of losing theirprincipal investment in the process ( Banerji et al., 2020 ). Investors often sell stocks that haveattained higher value than their initial investment, as they fear that the prices may go downagain and they may suffer a potential loss ( Massa and Simonov, 2005 ;Valaskova et al., 2019 ).Dar and Hakeem (2015) explained that loss aversion is a phenomenon in which investors aremore distraught about potential losses than they are content by advances from investment.Bailey et al. (2011) in their study confirmed investor behavior and their decision making to beheavily influenced by dispositions effect or loss aversion, wherein investors tend to sellstocks that have attained higher values and hold on to the ones that have lowered in theirIJOEM17,71722
	value. This often leads them to making biased investment decisions. Hence, it ishypothesized thatH1. Loss aversion significantly impacts the investment decision of retail investors.Herd behavior and investment decisionInvestors often tend to follow other investors decision, regardless of their own risk bearingcapacity or risk tolerance ( Waweru et al., 2008 ). This phenomenon is termed as herd behavior,also known as bandwagon effect, in investors. Investors who are not well-informed feel safewhen they mimic the investment pattern of other investors or masses ( Dar and Hakeem,2015). Previous literature has implied that investors do so to appear associated with theindividuals around them ( Banerji et al., 2020 ). Herd behavior often results in deviation ofsecurity prices from their actual fundamental values toward an unrealistic or nonsustainablevaluation ( Dewan and Dharni, 2019 ). Herding has been known to prevail based on the type ofinvestors, like individual retail investors tend to exhibit herd behavior more than institutionalinvestors do ( Goodfellow et al., 2009 ). Varied investor behavior has been observed acrossdifferent nations under the influence of herd behavior ( Shukla et al., 2020 ). Investors havebeen known to follow herd behavior in both bearish as well as bullish market conditions(Poshkwale and Mandal, 2014 ;Filip et al. , 2015 ).Poshakwale and Mandal (2014) alsoidentified that though prevalent in both bearish and bullish market, the impact of herdingeffect is more dominant in a bearish market. There are multiple theories postulated byresearchers linking herd behavior to trade volumes ( Chauhan et al., 2019 ), prevalence of acrisis ( Garg and Gulati, 2013 ), geographical demographics ( Ripoldi, 2016 ;Indars et al., 2019 ),age of investor ( Choi, 2016 ) etc. Thus, in this study researchers hypothesize that:H2. Herd behavior significantly affects the decision making of retail investors.FOMO and investment decisionFOMO prevails in individual when they see, read or learn about others ’actions and feel likethey ’re missing out on it ( Abel et al., 2016 ). FOMO has also been studied in the context ofconsumer behavior and how it influences consumers ’decision making process ( Kang et al.,2020). Same can be said about investors who under the influence of desire to earn higherprofits and feel they may miss out on potential opportunities if they do not take immediateactions ( Dennison, 2018 ;Kang et al., 2020 ). These actions may be biased as investors tend toignore facts when acting out of this fear. Shiva et al. (2020) in their study investigated therelation between investor FOMO and investment decision of retail investors and found astring relationship between the two. Consider a group of investors who have a commontendency toward one particular industry in the market. The said industry has been surging inthe past. Now, these investors would develop a FOMO on potential gain when they ’ve seenothers thriving by investing in the industry ( Hershfield, 2020 ). This investment FOMO thenstarts driving their investment decisions. Hence, it is hypothesized that:H3. Fear of missing out significantly affects the decision making of retail investors.Mediating role of FOMOStudies of past conducted in the context of behavioral finance and investment decisionprovide evidence that there are several variables that have been proven to mediate therelationships between the two. Several authors have studied the mediating role of risk anddifferent attributes of risk that mediates these relations ( Sitkin and Weingart, 1995 ;Riaz et al.,2012;Khan, 2014 ;Hunjra and Rehman, 2016 ;Saurabh and Nandan, 2018 ;Raheja and Dhiman,2019;Sadiq and Khan, 2019 ).Falahati et al.(2012) in their study analyzed the mediating role ofHerding andloss aversion instock markets1723
	financial behavior and financial strain. Lakey et al. (2008) studied judgement and decisionmaking while Ali (2011) andJamal et al. (2015) studied the role of attitude on the relationbetween behavioral biases and investme nt decisions. Some authors even pursuedfinancial literacy and financial self-efficacy as mediator variables ( Akhtar and Das, 2019 ;Ameliawati and Setiyani, 2018 ). Thus, with a similar theory in mind, FOMO has beentaken up as a mediating variable in the current study. Researchers in the past have notstudied the mediating role of FOMO on the relationship between biases and investmentdecisions. Thus, the findings of the present research would be quite beneficial in explainingthe subject matter.Researchers in past have identified a conne ction between FOMO and investors exertingherd behavior and aversion in the form of greed. Denison (2018) in his study establishedFOMO as a significant influencer that leads investors make hasty investment decisions toensure that they are able to keep up with their c olleagues and neighbor s. He also pointed outthat these investors are highly driven by thei r desire to earn more returns quickly and thusavoid any future loss. Kang et al. (2020) andTarjanne (2020) supported the relation betweenFOMO and herd behavior. They implied that the FOMO leads consumers to collectiveconsumption of products to spring psychological comfort within. An individual ’s collectiveconsumption decision is often influenced by others around him or her. And it is not hard tobelieve that these investment decisions are based on their friends ’or relatives ’advice as thechances of a conflict of interest arising in t his advice are much lower when compared toother sources ( Kuchler and Stroebel, 2021 ). Individuals are thus driven in their investmentby a FOMO when they see their friends and peers succeeding in stock market. Spread ofFOMO leads to herd behavior, and this conti nuously drives the prices of securities(Hershfield, 2020 ).Thus, the hypotheses developed from these literature are:H4. Loss aversion has a significant impact on fear of missing out in retail investors.H5. Herd behavior has a significant impact on fear of missing out in retail investors.H6. Fear of missing out in retail investors mediates the relationship between lossaversion and investment decision.H7. Fear of missing out in retail investors mediates the relationship between herdbehavior and investment decision.Figure 1 below depicts the research model adopted for the study.Investment Decision Loss Aversion Fear of Missing Out Herd behavior H1 H2 H3 H5 H4 Figure 1.Research modelIJOEM17,71724
	Research methodologyThe responses were recorded using a seven-point Likert scale where 1 stood for very stronglydisagree and 7 stood for very strongly agree. The data from respondents were collected viamail survey or through personal interviews. The items generated for the questionnaire thatwas done through extensive literature review are shown in Table 1 . The items in thequestionnaire were divided into two sections. The items measuring and recording thedemographics details of the respondents were incorporated in the first part of questionnairewhile the items measuring the latent constructs were incorporated in the second part of thequestionnaire.The target population for this study were retail investors who preferred investing inequity stocks securities in Indian stock market. In a study conducted by Securities ExchangeBoard of India (SEBI), it has been identified that more than 50% of the investors in India arefrom West region. This includes the state of Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh andChhattisgarh, which is the center of this study. The investors from this region, generallypreferred investment in equity and mutual funds, as compared to other avenues ofinvestment such as debentures, derivative or futures (SEBI, 2015). It has been empiricallyidentified in the same study that 33% of the total investors preferred investment in equity.In this study, the top brokerage firms operating in Chhattisgarh were identified throughChittorgarh Infotech ’s website ( https://www.chittorgarh.com/ ). The website has the topbrokerage firms listed according to their client base. From these, the top 5 brokerage firmswith maximum market share were acknowledged and their offices operating in Chhattisgarhwere known. The next step was to contact these offices/branches and seek out their assistancewith respect to their clientele. The brokerage firms were clearly explained about the purpose ofthe research, and it was ensured that no confidential details of their client were transferred.Only basic details like name, email and contact number were provided. It was ensured that thisinformation would not be used for any commercial purpose or for any kind of monetary gain.In case a brokerage firm was not interested in sharing the required information, the next entityin the list was contacted with the same agenda. The study was limited to Chhattisgarh asbrokerage firms outside Chhattisgarh were not ready to share their client information.Nonprobability purposive sampling was employed for selecting the respondents whowere based in Chhattisgarh, India. Purposive sampling was employed as it helped provideprecise and consistent results for the study ( Denzin and Lincoln, 2005 ). Studies conducted byShiva et al. (2020) ,Ali (2011) ,Hunjra and Rehman (2016) ,Akhtar and Das (2019) ,Raheja andDhiman (2019) andBaker et al., (2019) built around similar context to the current research,adopted purposive sampling. In the current research, researcher also used GPower 3.1software to determine adequate sample size. By using correct effect size and the testtechnique, GPower has been proven to produce almost error free calculation with reference tosample size measurement ( Erdfelder et al., 1996 ). Thus, the same was used for sample sizemeasurement in the current research as well. There were four latent constructs in the researchFactors 
	model, and a minimum effect size ( f2) of 0.05 at a statistical power of 95% was set as thecriteria for sample size determination. As per the results of GPower 3.1, total 262 respondentswere deemed to be adequate for the study ( Erdfelder et al., 1996 ;Faul et al., 2007 ,2009). Thedata collection process continued into three phases. In the first phase of survey, 500individuals from the selected list of respondents were emailed the questionnaire. As expectedfrom mail survey, the response rate was low and a total of 119 responses were received. Allthe items listed in questionnaire had to be mandatorily answered for submitting theirresponse. This also helped ensure that no submission came back with missing response toitems. Once the data were received from first phase it was analyzed for its reliability.Responses with zero variation were analyzed, and it was realized that respondents in the saiddata had agreed to all the items of the questionnaire. Such responses were eliminated from theresponse set to avoid acquiescence bias. Acquiescence bias is a phenomenon quite commonwith survey methods where respondents have been known to agree to all the items in thequestionnaire.Based on the abovementioned analysis, 27 responses were eliminated from the dataset asthey had no variation in their response pattern. This left researcher with a total of 92responses from the first phase of data collection. Looking at the response rate, the next phaseof data collection Phase 2 was planned with a larger size of respondents to ensure a highernumber of responses back from the sample. As expected, reaching out to a largerdemographic paid back with a comparatively larger response set from Phase 1. In Phase 2 ofdata collection, out of the 800 respondents emailed, 240 were filled. These were again checkedfor acquiescence bias and after eliminating responses with zero variation, 209 responses wereretained.Combining the data from Phase 1 and Phase 2, researcher had a total of 301 useableresponses for the study. In a final attempt to move the response count a little further than 301,researcher started calling individuals randomly from the list of investors. In the third andfinal phase of data collection, 22 useable and complete responses were collected bringing thetotal up to 323 out of total 359 responses received throughout the data collection process.About 323 seemed as an adequate sample size as the measured sample size was estimatedbetween 300 and 350. The data attained were then analyzed using Smart PLS 3.3.2 software.Data analysisThe demographic profile of the respondents is mentioned in Table 2 .Demographic variable Category Frequency Percentage (%)Age 26 –35 84 2636–45 100 3146–55 94 29Above 55 45 14Gender Male 149 46Female 174 54Annual income ≤250,000 71 22250,001 –500,000 113 35500,001 –750,000 81 25>750,000 58 18Percentage of income invested in securities <10% 109 3410–30% 128 39>30% 86 27Note(s): Demographic distribution of the respondents of current researchSource(s) : Authors ’calculationTable 2.Respondents ’profileIJOEM17,71726
	Out of the 323 respondents, 46% were male, and 54% were female investors. Thirty-onepercent of the respondents were from 36 –45 age groups, while 26%, 29% and 14% were from26–35, 46 –55 and above 55 age groups. About 22% of the responded had an annual income ofless than ₹250,000, whereas 35% to the income group of ₹250,001 to 500,000. Remaining 22%and 18% respondent earned between Rs 500,001 –750,000 and more than Rs. 7,50,000 perannum, respectively. Fifty-six percent respondents had a low-risk appetite while forty-fourpercent believed that they are ready to take high risk in order to achieve a higher return fromtheir investment. About 34% respondent invested less than 10% of their income in Securities,39% invested 10% –30% of their income, whereas only 27% invested more than 30% of theirincome in the securities.Common method varianceOne of the most important aspect of behavioral or psychological study using PLS-SEM is theprevalence of common method bias ( Conway and Lance, 2010 ). Common method bias oftenresults from using a biased instrument, and it is a must for behavioral studies to ensure nocommon method bias in the study ( Kock, 2015 ). Hence, in this study the common method biasis assessed using Harman ’s one factor test. The test suggests that all the items from themeasurement instrument, i.e. questionnaire used, when loaded into a single factor should notaccount for more than 50% variance ( Podsakoff and Organ, 1986 ;Weiet al., 2011 ). Testing thedata collected, using unrotated principal component analysis, it is revealed that all the itemsput together into a single factor explained 45.309% variance. Hence, it is confirmed that nocritical or serious risk of common method bias is present as the total variance explained by asingle factor was less than 50%.Measurement model assessmentFigure 2 depicts the measurement model of the study. There are four latent constructs in themodel, namely loss aversion, herd behavior, FOMO on investment and profit earningopportunities, and investment decisions. In the first step of data analysis, the reliability andvalidity of exogenous variables in the outer model are assessed using SmartPLS 3.3.2 andtwo-stage systematic procedure ( Anderson and Gerbing, 1988 ;Ringle et al. , 2015 ). Acomposite reliability (CR) value of more than 0.7 is an indicator of good reliability while anaverage variance extracted (AVE) value of more than 0.5 indicates satisfactory convergentLSAV1LSAV2LSAV3HRDB1HRDB2HRDB3HRDB40.7190.8760.8950.8520.8950.8110.9250.5690.2590.0920.781 0.800 0.778 0.769 0.691 0.753Loss AversionHerd BehaviorFOMO1FOMOInvestmentDecisionFOMO2 FOMO3 FOMO4 FOMO5 FOMO60.1280.5110.5850.6220.8250.8580.7830.840INVD1INVD2INVD3INVD4Figure 2.Measurement modelHerding andloss aversion instock markets1727
	validity ( Hair et al., 2016 ,2017). Another measure of reliability is Cronbach ’s alpha valueaccording to which, an alpha coefficient of 0.7 or above indicated good reliability of constructs(Cronbach, 1951 ). Measurement model assessment results depicted in Table 3 , reveal good CRand convergent validity in the model. CR, Cronbach ’s alpha and rho_A values of allconstructs are more than 0.7, and AVE values are more than 0.5 for each construct. Hence, it isconcluded that the measurement model has good reliability and validity.Post assessing CR and convergent validit y of the constructs, their discriminantvalidity is assessed. For this, there are two methods, first suggested by Fornell andLarcker (1981) and second HTMT criterion by Henseler et al. (2015) .P a s tl i t e r a t u r ei m p l i e sthat HTMT criteria for measuring discriminant validity is better than Fornell –Larckercriterion, as it accounts for better sensitivity and specificity rate ( Xia and Chengb, 2017 ;Rasoolimanesh et al. , 2019 ). According to Fornell and Larcker (1981) , discriminantvalidity is achieved when the square root of a factor ’s AVE is more than its correlationcoefficients with other variables. For HTMT criteria, calculated value less than 0.9indicates satisfactory discriminant validity ( Gold et al. , 2001 ;Henseler et al. ,2 0 1 5 ;Voorhees et al. , 2016 ). Results reported in Tables 4 and 5 indicate good discriminantvalidity. Finally, the model fit is also a ssessed using Standardized Root Mean SquareResidual (SRMR) where a value of less than 0.08 establishes acceptable model fit ( Hairet al., 2016 ). For the measurement model in this study, calculated SRMR is equal to 0.069,less than 0.08, thus model fit is deemed acceptable ( Hu and Bentler, 1999 ).Construct Items Loading/Weight CR Cronbach ’s alpha rho A AVELoss aversion (LSAV) LSAV1 0.719 0.871 0.779 0.812 0.695LSAV2 0.876LSAV3 0.895Herd behavior (HRDB) HRDB1 0.852 0.927 0.894 0.903 0.760HRDB2 0.895HRDB3 0.811HRDB4 0.925FOMO FOMO1 0.781 0.893 0.856 0.856 0.582FOMO2 0.800FOMO3 0.778FOMO4 0.753FOMO5 0.691FOMO6 0.769Investment decision (INVD) INVD1 0.825 0.896 0.846 0.847 0.684INVD2 0.858INVD3 0.783INVD4 0.840Note(s): Item loadings/weights and reliability results for the measurement modelSource(s) : Authors ’calculationFOMO HRDB INVD LSAVFOMO 0.763HRDB 0.490 0.872INVD 0.753 0.448 0.827LSAV 0.674 0.405 0.584 0.834Source(s) : Authors ’calculationTable 3.Measurement modelassessment resultsTable 4.Discriminant validityassessment results(Fornell –Larckercriterion)IJOEM17,71728
	Structural model assessmentIn structural model assessment, the first step is to check for multicollinearity issues.According to Diamantopoulos and Siguaw (2006) , the primary reason for existence ofmulticollinearity issues in any model is high intercorrelation amongst variables. Evaluatingvariance inflation factor (VIF) is standard methodology to assess multicollinearity issues in amodel. According to Diamantopoulos and Siguaw (2006) , VIF values of less than 3.33indicates no multicollinearity issues in the model. Hair et al. (2017) suggested that VIF valuesless than 5 is a satisfactory indicator of absence of multicollinearity issues in model.Looking at the VIF results shown in Table 6 , VIF values of all the constructs is in the range of1.196 –2.043, confirming no multicollinearity issues in the inner model.Next step is to test the hypotheses of the study. Figure 3 depicts the structural model of thecurrent research. Using SmartPLS, the hypotheses are tested using bootstrapping technique.Bootstrapping, a resampling procedure, is run with a subsample size of 5,000 as large samplesize ensures lower variance between original values and mean values of regression pathcoefficients. Bootstrapping also helps ensure stability of estimates ( Davcik, 2014 ). As per thehypotheses of the study, loss aversion and herd behavior are related to both FOMO andinvestment decision. It is also hypothesized that FOMO has an impact on investmentdecisions of retail investors. As per the research model, loss aversion and herd behaviorinfluenced investment decision via FOMO, hence role of FOMO as a mediating variable in lossaversion and herd behavior ’s relationship with investment decision is also assessed.Bootstrapping results depicted in Table 7 infer that loss aversion and herd behavior have apositive and significant impact on FOMO in investors and investment decisions. Lossaversion influences both investment decision and FOMO significantly (depicted in Table 7 )thus supporting hypotheses H1andH4. Herd behavior has a small but significant influenceon investment decision and a significant influence on FOMO supporting H2andH5. FOMOhas a quite significant impact on investment decisions hence supporting H3.Results report a high t-value in the impact that loss aversion has on FOMO and FOMO hason investment decision. This further strengthens the hypothesis of the study depicting astrong influence of FOMO on investment decisions and loss aversion inducing FOMO in retailinvestors. Once could also infer that the presence of FOMO in an investor makes them highlysusceptible to loss aversion while making their investment decisions. The direct effect ofFOMO on retail investor ’s investment decision is quite high compared to loss aversion andFOMO HRDB INVD LSAVFOMOHRDB 0.553INVD 0.877 0.506LSAV 0.813 0.473 0.710Source(s) : Authors ’calculationFOMO Herd behavior Investment decision Loss aversionFOMO 2.043Herd behavior 1.196 1.333Investment decisionLoss aversion 1.196 1.858Source(s) : Authors ’calculationTable 5.Discriminant validityassessment results(HTMT criterion)Table 6.Variance inflationfactor valuesHerding andloss aversion instock markets1729
	herd behavior. The coefficient of determination R2and adjusted R2values of investmentdecision are 0.585 and 0.581, respectively. This infers good predictive precision of thepredictor variables in explaining investment decisions ( Cohen, 1988 ). The impact of lossaversion and herd behavior on investment decision through FOMO was significant. Same isdepicted in Tables 7 and 8 . This reveals that in the presence of FOMO ( H6andH7), both lossaversion and herd behavior are influencing investment decision more significantly incomparison to absence of FOMO ( H1andH2). These results support the hypotheses H6andH7, i.e. FOMO mediates the relations between loss aversion, herd behavior and investmentdecision. This also indicates that FOMO plays complementary mediator role in therelationships as the direction of predictor biases and mediating variables is same towardinvestment decision ( Zhou et al., 2007 ).Cohen (1988) came up with process of measuring the effect size ( f2) of the constructsestablishing that f2value of more than 0.35 implied massive effect, 0.15 –0.35 inferredmoderate effect and less than 0.15 inferred little effect. Loss aversion ( f250.021) and herdbehavior ( f250.015) have little effect while FOMO ( f250.456) has high effect on investmentdecisions.

	residual value (SRMR) of the model is 0.069 which is lower than 0.08, recommended maximumthreshold value ( Hu and Bentler, 1999 ). Predictive relevance, i.e. Stone –Geisser ’sQ2value(Geisser, 1974 ;Stone, 1974 ) of the model is assessed using blindfolding technique, with anomission distance of eight. The Q2value is 0.388 establishing satisfactory predictiverelevance of the model.Implications and discussionThe study attempts to analyze the influence of loss aversion, herd behavior and FOMO onretail investor ’s investment decisions. Despite the availability of several research onbehavioral biases and their effect on investment decisions, this study takes it a step furtherand analyses the mediating role of FOMO on the relationship of loss aversion and herdbehavior with retail investor ’s investment decision. Results reveal that retail investor ’sinvestment decisions are significantly influenced by all three variables. Findings of this studyare in line with previous studies on same subject ( Caparrelli et al., 2004 ;Sahi et al., 2013 ;Dennison, 2018 ;Raheja and Dhiman, 2019 ;Shiva et al., 2020 ;Shukla et al., 2020 ). Out of thethree predictors, FOMO has the most impact on investment decisions of retail investors,followed by loss aversion and herd behavior. As per the results, herd behavior only has aminor impact on their investment decisions. The results also reveal that FOMO plays acomplementary mediating role in the loss aversion and herd behavior ’s relationship withretail investor ’s investment decision.The major focus of this study is the mediating role of FOMO on relationship of lossaversion and herd behavior with investment decisions. Researchers across different countriesand markets have been studying FOMO in different contexts like consumer behavior,decision making, social anxiety, marketing appeals etc. The study is an attempt to check theimpact of FOMO in the field of behavioral finance. The results of the study show that lossaversion and herd behavior are significant even in absence of FOMO in retail investors. But inthe presence of FOMO, the influence of loss aversion and herd behavior on investmentdecision has been amplified significantly. Out of the total effect herd behavior and lossaversion have on investment decision, 64% and 73% of the variance respectively have beenaccounted for in the presence of FOMO. This implies that retail investors may normallyexhibit a certain degree of loss aversion or herding in their investment decisions, but if theyare prone to FOMO, their investment decisions would be biased by loss aversion and herdbehavior even more. Since the direction of influence of aversion and herding on investmentdecision are same in absence as well as presence of FOMO, the mediation has beencategorized as complementary mediation. The mediation is partial in nature, since thevariance accounted for (VAF) values are between 20 and 80% ( Zhou et al., 2007 ).The study adds to the standing body of literature available on behavioral biases and theireffect on investment decision, with added value of the influence of FOMO on these relations.Behavioral finance has been a topic of interest for researchers on a global level for quite somePredecessorconstruct (a)Direct effect oninvestmentdecision ( b)Indirect effecton investmentdecisions ( c)Total effect oninvestmentdecision ( d)Varianceaccountedfor (c/d)Mediation byFOMOLoss aversion 0.128 0.354 0.482 0.73 ComplementarymediationHerd behavior 0.092 0.161 0.253 0.64 ComplementarymediationFOMO 0.622 – 0.622 ––Source(s) : Authors ’calculationTable 8.Direct, indirect andtotal effects ofindependent variableson dependent variableHerding andloss aversion instock markets1731
	time now and even in modern times, it is considered as an important subject of study. Thesebiases often cause anomalies in the market as the retail investors are more focused oncollective or just a handful of information and ignore actual facts that should be considered intheir investment decision making process ( Wood and Zaichkowsky, 2004 ). Hence, a clearpicture of these biases with their behavior in presence of FOMO fills the gap identified fromthe past literature. The results of the study contributing to the subject would be of great value.The practical implications from these findings could be drawn by retail investors andfinancial analysts across the globe, who trade in security markets. Retail investors whilechoosing their investment avenues should always keep in mind the influence herd behavior,loss aversion and FOMO could have on their investment decisions. As evident by past studiesconducted in the same subject areas as this study, these biases and their influence are notlimited to a particular country or a single market. These biases have a global presence andhence retail investors should place a check on these to ensure their investment decision arefree from these biases. This would help ensure absence of any error in judgement and achieveoptimum return on investment. And consequently, this would develop a sense of financialsatisfaction within them. Financial analysts should take a note of these biases and how theycan impact retail investors as these cause irregularities in security markets. They shouldcheck for recent market trends and avoid investing in stocks that have recently fluctuated invalue as it might be a consequence of investment decision solely based on collectiveinformation or statistically unconfirmed facts.ConclusionThe study confirms the significant influence of loss aversion, herding effect and FOMO ininvestors on retail investor ’s investment decision. The study also assesses the mediating roleof FOMO on loss aversion and herd behavior ’s relationship with investment decision. It wasobserved that the presence of FOMO significantly increases the effect of loss aversion andherd behavior on investment decisions. The implications and findings of the study could helpretail investors and financial planners keep a check on these biases and avoid error ofjudgement during their decision making process.Limitations and scope for future researchThis study is bound by some limitations. First, the study considered herd behavior and lossaversion only. Future researchers can consider other heuristic and prospect biases and assesshow they influence investment decision in presence of FOMO. Second, a moderating variablelike gender, income, etc., could be introduced in the model to check if there is a possibility ofmoderated mediation. Lastly, the respondents who participated in this study are all based atChhattisgarh. The brokerage firms that agreed to participate in the current research are allbased in Chhattisgarh and hence had clientele based in Chhattisgarh as well. Given that thetarget populations details necessary for data collection, like investor ’s name, email, contactnumber, etc., had to be extracted from brokerage firms, it was difficult to extract these fromfirms situated outside Chhattisgarh due to limited reach. A sample covering a differentgeographical area could also be studied using the same model to identify the behavioralbiases for that particular region. Similar results from other demographics could confirm thegeneralization of this study ’s results and findings.

Article Type:  Research Paper    Fear of Missing Out and Student Interest  in Stocks Investment during Covid -19 Pandemic   Dony Sudrajat  Abstract : The emergence of the Covid -19 virus in Indonesia for the first time in March 2020 immediately had a significant impact on the condition of the domestic stock market. However, while the pandemic occurred, the number of capital market investors increased alm ost three times in 2019. Based on demographic data at the Indonesian Central Securities Depository, students are the second -highest number of investors. This study aims to analyze whether the fear of missing out factor affects student behavior in making st ock investment decisions during the covid -19 pandemic. Fear of missing out on investment is the behavior of investors dependent on social media. Such behavior cannot be separated from students who tend to be more active in using social media, especially am id a pandemic. This study takes a case study of students from Universitas Muhammadiyah Yogyakarta, considering that this campus has a proactive student activity unit in terms of stock investment, namely the Capital Market Study Group. The data collection t echnique was in the form of a questionnaire distributed to 100 respondents, and the data was then processed using multiple regression analysis. This study shows that fear of missing out has a positive and significant relationship with student interest in s tocks investment along with return variable, stock prices, and age.  Keywords:  Investment ; Stocks ; Students ; Pandemic  JEL Classification : O16; G11    Introduction   In the economic environment amid the COVID -19 pandemic, investors need to be more careful when making investments, given that stock markets worldwide have experienced a decline on average ( Ngwakwe , 2020), including the Composite Stock Price Index (IHSG) of the Indonesia Stock Exchange. In the first quarter, the IHSG experienced a very d rastic decline. The emergence of the Covid -19 virus in Indonesia for the first time in March 2020 immediately had a significant impact on the condition of the domestic stock market. The Composite Stock Price Index fell sharply to 3,937.63 on March 24, 20201. The negative sentiment was the impact of the response of investors who carried out massive stock sales following the spread of COVID -19 in Indonesia. To prevent the spread of COVID -19, the government immediately adopted a Large -Scale Social Restriction (PSBB) policy. It also slowed down the economy's wheels, causing several  AFFILIATION:  Department of Economics, Faculty of Economics and Business, Universitas Muhammadiyah Yogyakarta, Special Region of Yogya karta, Indonesia   *CORRESPONDENCE:  dony.sudrajat.feb18@mail.umy.ac.id   THIS ARTICLE IS AVAILABLE IN: http://journal.umy.ac.id/index.php/jerss    DOI:  10.18196/jerss.v6i2.15319   CITATION:  Sudrajat , D.

	Sudrajat  Fear of Missing Out and Student Interest  …   Journal of Economics Research and Social Sciences , 2022 | 116 economic sectors' activities to stop. All sectoral indices showed negative performance, especially the various industrial sectors ( -19.34%), the financial sector ( -18.58%), and the infrastructure sector ( -14.76%).2  Despite experiencing COVID -19 shocks at  the beginning of 2020, the growth of Single Investor Identification (SID), or the number of investors in the capital market, experienced a significant increase until the following year, 56.21% growth in 2020 and 74.15% in 2021 in the third quarter. It mea ns that during the last year’s first quarter pandemic, there was an increase in the number of investors in the capital market to almost three times compared to 2019 before the COVID -19 pandemic. The difficult conditions during the COVID -19 pandemic have in creased public awareness of the importance of financial literacy for financial management. The limited activities during the pandemic do not seem to dampen the public's interest to jump in and learning in the capital market.   The IHSG was in the range of 4000 at the start of the COVID -19 pandemic. The decline in stock prices is momentum for potential investors to jump into the capital market, considering that the opportunity to make profits will be much higher in the future by waiting for the stock price t o rise again to its regular price. In subsequent developments, the IHSG gradually increased until it reached 6000 and above. Therefore, it is necessary to have accuracy in making investment decisions, both in terms of the type and timing of the investment (Ibrahim & Adib, 2018). Based on demographic data at the Indonesian Central Securities Depository (KSEI), students are the second largest number of employees after employees, with 27.59% of the total individual investors in the capital market. This figure shows early awareness of the importance of financial literacy, which will undoubtedly positively impact future generations. With a capital that is not too large, novice investors such as students can get stocks with good fundamentals at meager prices at th e beginning of the stock price crash during the pandemic.   This study then aims to investigate whether there is a fear of missing out factor that encourages students to invest in stocks during the Covid -19 pandemic. Fear of Missing Out on investment is the behavior of investors dependent on social media. They absorb too much information, so they feel anxious and miss the momentum in making investment decisions. According to Przybylski  et al.  (2013), FOMO is a person's fear of missing out on  social opportunities that encourage that person to consistently connect with others and follow the latest news about everything other people are doing. An investor who has just entered the capital market usually has weak psychology or can be easily provok ed by information on social networks. It will affect investors in making hasty decisions without a comprehensive analysis first. Social media provides a space for a person to communicate actively with others and makes it easier for individuals to access new information (Burke  et al. , 2010). The abundance of information about stocks requires investors to be careful in making all decisions so as not just to follow the crowd.   This research is interesting considering that, as far as the author knows, no previo us research in Indonesia discusses the decision to invest in stocks among students during the  2Indonesia Stock Exchange, 2020.  
	Sudrajat  Fear of Missing Out and Student Interest  …   Journal of Economics Research and Social Sciences , 2022 | 117 Covid -19 pandemic by linking the fear of missing out factor. This study takes a case study of students from Universitas Muhammadiyah Yogyakarta, considering that this campus has a proactive student activity unit in terms of stock investment, namely the Capital Market Study Group (KSPM).   Several previous studies have discussed investment decisions before the pandemic in the Indonesian context, but none have addressed this behavior after the pandemic. For example, Putri  and Rahyuda  (2017) examines the effect of financial literacy level and sociodemographic factors on individual investment decision behavior. Respondents in this study were unmarried employees in  Denpasar with a sample of 83 people. Determination of the sample uses non -probability sampling with an accidental sampling approach. Data were analyzed using multiple linear regression analysis. The results of this study indicate that the level of financi al literacy and gender have a positive effect on the behavior of individual investment decisions.   Tandio and Widanaputra  (2016) examined the effect of capital market training, return, risk perception, gender, and technological advances on student investme nt interest. The researcher obtained the research data directly through a questionnaire given to 95 respondents. The sampling method used by the researcher is the purposive sampling method. Primary data, which has a nominal scale, is then converted into qu antitative data in the form of intervals using the method of successive intervals. Based on the regression analysis results, capital market training and returns significantly affect investment interest. Meanwhile, the variables of risk perception, gender, and technological progress do not affect investment interest.   Pranyot o and Siregar  (2015) examines  the factors influencing people's interest in investing in the capital market: economic literacy, social relations, attitudes, norms, and self -control. The s ample of this research is the people of Lampung who invest in the capital market with 100 respondents. Multiple regression analysis was used to answer the research objectives. The results of this study indicate that financial literacy, social relations, at titudes, norms, and interests have a significant effect on investment, while self-control does not affect investment interest.   Pratama  et al.  (2020) examines the behavioral factors of investors that can influence a person's investment decisions in the for m of shares on the Indonesia Stock Exchange. The study data were taken from a survey of 422 retail investors on the Indonesia Stock Exchange, distributed through online media. This research uses quantitative analysis and is based on behavioral financial th eories consisting of investor sentiment behavior, overconfident behavior, over/under reaction behavior, herd behavior, and risk perception. The study results indicate that an investor's investment decision in the stock market is strongly influenced by the above behaviors, except for overly confident behavior.   In its development, several studies have discussed interest in stocks investment after the pandemic, but the sample categories used are different from this research. Wi and Anggraeni  (2020), for examp le, discusses the influence of trust, financial literacy, 
	Sudrajat  Fear of Missing Out and Student Interest  …   Journal of Economics Research and Social Sciences , 2022 | 118 motivation, investment knowledge, return, and risk on employee interest in investing in the capital market during the Covid -19 pandemic. The method used in this study is a quantitative approach with  primary data obtained through questionnaires. The sample in this study was 166 company employees spread across Tangerang and Jakarta. Data analysis using multiple regression. The results of his research state that trust, financial literacy, motivation, an d return affect the interest of company employees to invest in the capital market.   Atmaja  and Widoatmodjo  (2021) examined the effect of motivation, risk perception, and investment knowledge on investment interest during the Covid -19 pandemic. The number o f samples used in the study was 200, selected using purposive sampling, and their responses were obtained using a questionnaire. The results of this study indicate that investment motivation and knowledge positively affect interest in investing during the Covid -19 pandemic, while risk perception does not significantly affect interest in investing during the pandemic.    Research Method   Universitas Muhammadiyah Yogyakarta is the object of this research, with the research subjects being students of Universitas Muhammadiyah Yogyakarta who invest in stocks during the Covid -19 pandemic. The technique used in the sampling of this research is the purposive sampling technique. According to Sugiyono (2011), the purposive sampling technique is a sampling tec hnique based on predetermined criteria. To determine the number of samples required, the researchers used the Lemeshow formula and obtained 100 respondents.   The study data were collected by distributing questionnaires to students at Universitas Muhammadiy ah Yogyakarta following the criteria. The questionnaire is a primary data collection tool with a survey method to obtain respondents' opinions (Pujihastuti, 2010). The distribution of the questionnaires was carried out in the following ways: (1) directly by the researcher; (2) shared via social media; (3) ask others for help to spread. Using a Likert scale to measure variables makes it easier for researchers to assess respondents' responses. The Likert scale measures attitudes, opinions, and perceptions of a person or group of people about social events or phenomena (Sugiyono, 2010).   This study uses multiple linear regression analysis to determine the relationship between two or more independent variables and the dependent variable. Meanwhile, the equation of multiple linear regression is as follows:     Y = a + b 1X1 + b 2X2 + b 3X3 + b 4X4+ b 5X5 + b 6X6 + e   (1)  Information :  Y = Decision Investation ; a =constant ; b =Regression coefficient ; X1 =Fear of missing out ; X2 =Yield ; X3 = Price share ; X4 =Risk profile ; X5 =Friendship environment ; X6 =Age ; e = error term . 
	Sudrajat  Fear of Missing Out and Student Interest  …   Journal of Economics Research and Social Sciences , 2022 | 119 The dependent variable in this study is investment decision making which is seen when investors start investing, buying and selling decisions, satisfaction with the decisions taken, and the expe cted results. The investment decision variable is measured using a Likert scale. The final value of the dependent variable is obtained by averaging all components, which is then transformed into a number with an average of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 s o that the variable's value can be continuous. The unit of this variable is the standard deviation.   The indicators in the questionnaire used to measure the fear of missing out variables are the tendency of investors to follow the buying and selling trend of certain stocks and the behavior of investors who are afraid to lose their momentum in investing in stocks. The fear of missing out variable was measured using a Likert scale. The final value for this variable is obtained by averaging all components in t he variable, which is then transformed into a number with an average of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. The unit of this variable is the standard deviation.   The return variable uses the indicator of investor satisfaction with the results obtained from in vesting in stock instruments, the form of return received is in the form of capital gains and dividends. The return variable was measured using a Likert scale. The final value for this variable is obtained by averaging all components in the variable, which  is then transformed into a number with an average of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. The unit of this variable is the standard deviation.   The indicators used to measure the stock price variable are the low stock prices during the COVID -19 pandemic and t he size of the capital needed to invest in stocks. The stock price variable was measured using a Likert scale. The final value for this variable is obtained by averaging all components in the variable, which is then transformed into a number with an averag e of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. The unit of this variable is the standard deviation.   Table 1  Questions in measuring risk aversion  No. Question  1. Suppose you are offered two ways to make money.

	Sudrajat  Fear of Missing Out and Student Interest  …   Journal of Economics Research and Social Sciences , 2022 | 120 The risk profile shows an individual's view of the risks faced, especially regarding the risk of investing in specific instruments. This study measured the risk profile using a risk aversion measurement scale. Risk aversion shows the level of risk aversion carried out by individuals on stock investment decisions. Risk aversion is measured by asking several questions with different schemes and risk levels. Que stions to measure the risk profile can be seen further in Table 1.   The value of which depends on the choice of answers to the questions given to each individual. It will then determine the risk profile of the respondent. Based on the risk aversion measure ment scheme, there are five categories for determining individual risk profiles. Very high indicates that individuals have the lowest level of risk aversion, whereas individuals with this profile are the most daring in facing risks. Deficient means individ uals who have the highest risk aversion. Individuals of this type have the highest prudence in the face of threat. They do not want to experience losses in investing. Moderate indicates a moderate level of risk aversion. Moderately low indicates a relative ly low level of risk aversion. Rather high indicates a reasonably high level of risk aversion. Then, the measurement of the risk profile is converted into a scale with a score between 1 to 5. Furthermore, the final value of the risk profile variable is obt ained by averaging all components and then converted into a number with an average of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. The unit of this variable is the standard deviation. The scale is determined based on the questions asked to the respondents.   The indica tor used to measure the friendship environment variable is whether or not the friendship environment influences the decision to invest in stocks as seen from the invitation or motivation caused by the environment. The friendship environment variable was me asured using a Likert scale. The final value for this variable is obtained by averaging all components in the variable, which is then transformed into a number with an average of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. The unit of this variable is the standard de viation.    Result  and Discussion   Table 2 shows the results of multiple regression analysis for the determinants of student interest in investing in stocks during the pandemic. Based on the results of multiple regressions and t -tests that have been carried out, the variable fear of missing  out has a positive and significant relationship with student investment decision -making during the covid -19 pandemic. It shows that the higher the fear of missing out felt by investors, the higher the stock investment decision -making. This finding is in l ine with Pratama et al. (2020), who found that herd is positively related to investment decisions. This behavior encourages investors to act according to what most other investors do. This phenomenon is due to the uncertainty of the decisions taken by inve stors.   The yield variable positively relates to stock investment decision -making during the COVID -19 pandemic. It shows that any increase in the perception of returns on investing in stocks is associated with an increase in investment decision -making. Thi s finding is in line with Tandio and Widanaputra  (2016), which shows that the return variable positively 
	Sudrajat  Fear of Missing Out and Student Interest  …   Journal of Economics Research and Social Sciences , 2022 | 121 relates to student investment interest. The returns from investing in stocks are an attraction for every student to invest. There is investor confidenc e in the prospect of the capital market in the future being able to provide the expected results. Meanwhile, there is a positive relationship between stock prices and investment decision -making during the COVID -19 pandemic. It shows that the higher the sto ck price, the higher the investment decision -making.   Table 2  Results of Multiple Regression Analysis  Variable  Coefficient  t-count  p-value  Fear of Missing Out  0.152*  1.75  0.083  Yield  0.341***  3.54  0.001  Stock price  0.292***  3.22  0.002  Risk Profile  -0.040  0.49  0.627  Friendship Environment  0.051  0.60  0.550  Age 0.115**  1.93  0.056  constant  -1.06  1.93  0.057  F-statistics  10,19  F-table  2.32  Adjusted R -square  0.357  Observation  100  The risk profile variable is unrelated to stock investment decision -making during the covid -19 pandemic. It shows that a high or low level of risk aversion does not guarantee an increase in investment decision -making. This finding is in line with Wi and Anggraeni  (2020), which shows that the risk profile does not affect company employees' interest in investing in the capital market. The friendship environment variable is unrelated to stock investment decision -making during the covid -19 pandemic. It shows th at a friendship environment does not guarantee an increase in investment decision -making. This finding contradicts Pranyoto  and Siregar  (2015), who found that friendship positively relates to investment interest. Humans as social beings tend to establish f riendly relations with others, so the influence of these relationships will likely arise. When a person has an environment where most people are stocks investor, the opportunity to enter the investment world is also more significant.   Finally, the age variable has a positive and significant relationship with student investment decision -making during the COVID -19 pandemic. It shows that the older the age, the higher the level of investment decision -making. However, it is different from t he results of Putri and Rahyuda  (2020), who states that age is not related to investment decisions because the age of respondents who are pretty young, between 18 - 29 years, tend not to think long term when making investment decisions. This age is primari ly a student or a person who has just had a job. At these times, the decision to invest is still not formed because it has not yet achieved financial stability.      
	Sudrajat  Fear of Missing Out and Student Interest  …   Journal of Economics Research and Social Sciences , 2022 | 122 Conclusion   This study found that the variable fear of missing out was positively and signi ficantly related to the behavior of Universitas Muhammadiyah Yogyakarta students in making decisions to invest in stocks during the COVID -19 pandemic. It shows that the higher the fear of missing out felt by investors, the higher the stock investment decis ion-making. While yield, stock price, and age variables were also positively related to student interest in investing in stocks. It means that the expectation of high yields, continued rising stock prices, and a more mature student age encourage them to in vest in stocks. Meanwhile, their risk profile and friendship environment are unrelated to their interest in investing in stocks.

The relationship was further analysed by incorporating the role of Investor related Fear -of-Missing -Out (I -FoMO) which is different from traditional FOMO in Indian Financial Markets. The information asymmtary as generated by absence of mobile phone coupled with fear of missing important information in financial markets used for extensive investment decisions was determined  by conducting survey method. A total of 265 retail investors were used for analysing the data and to explore this new phenomenon by Partial Least Square Structural Equational Modelling (PLS – SEM) in SmartPLS version 3.3.2. Further, Importance Performance  Map Analysis (IMPA) was applied to investigate the critical factors for determining investor behaviour. The results revealed that there is a tendency to exhibit overtrading by retail investors in the state of fear of no investment information and lack of convenience due to news in smartphones. The similar phenomenon was experienced where Nomophobia lead extensively to I -FoMO which mediates the relationship of No -mobiles and investor behaviour. The study provides a new dimension to the theoretical framework s in behavioural finance where media studies and information dissemination through smartphones to understand investor behaviour. The study not only validates NMP -Questionnaire in media studies but also investigates new scale of I -FoMOin behavioural finance  to understand the aspects of fear and anxiety among human behaviour in Information Systems (IS) Research.

INTRODUCTION  Investment is one of the most important decisions that consumers make in their lives, as it involves risk and can have life -long consequences for their wealth management (Raghubir and Das, 2010; He et al., 2008).The investment decisions attain much more significance with the use of modern technology and the rapidly changing information in the stock markets. The use of mobile phone has brought radical changes in the investment decisions by the Indian population, since the initiation of the liberalization pol icies in India in the 1990s. With the explosive growth in the availability and affordability of the mobile phones in societies, even in the poor and most remote communities, the investors are using the digital communication revolution in making their inves tment decisions (Shana et al., 2019) . The mobile phone has become the primary access point to the information and for social media interaction, with nearly five billion current active users in the global market, which is many times the number of active internet -connected personal computers (Shana et al., 2019) . However, two negative phenomena of no mobile phone phobia 
	3  (Nomophobia) and the fear of missing out (FOMO) on social media have emerged with the modern technology (Gezgin et al., 2019), which present a high risk especially for the investors, who are dependent on the technology for making their investment decisions.   The Nomophobia has created a state of panic in the minds of the investors about staying away from their smartphones, and creating a sense  of anxiety for being out of the network range or out of battery power (Gezgin et al., 2019). This has resulted in several behavioural pattern among Nomophobic individuals (Durak, 2018 ). The Nomophobic individuals develop the habit of checking their mobile  phones frequently, sleeping with their mobile phone besides their pillow, and always carrying an extra battery power bank with them ( Durak, 2018 ). These individuals spend lots of time on social media to reduce their anxiety in the FOMO on important inform ation (Franchina et al., 2018; Przybylski et al., 2013; VandenAbeeleand and Van Rooij, 2016). Therefore, Nomophobia individuals follow up the messages on social media in the mobile applications frequently and obtain updates about developments in the countr y and social environment.   The research literature in this area has only focused on the prevalence of Nomophobia and FOMO among the younger generation, and the common disorders due to the excessive use of smartphones and social media (Ak and Yıldırım, 201 8; Gezgin and C akır, 2016; Gezgin et al., 2017; Gezgin, 2017; Go kler et al., 2016). However, there have not been any studies to our knowledge that focus on understanding the behavioural patterns of Nomophobic individuals.   The mobile phones may have increased the access of the investors to the real -time investment information; however, it has vastly impacted their behavioural patterns in making investment decisions (Brown et al., 2015). The investors develop I -FoMO, the fear of missing out on investment i nformation, if they don‘t remain continuously connected (Saft, 2015; Wadhwa, 2017). The stochastic information on social media, the lucrative looking advertisements, and I -FoMO on investment information interact together to affect the investors‘ investment  decisions. Past quantitative studies found that investors‘ investment behaviour affects capital markets (Miller and Skinner, 2015), market information (Bushee et al., 2010), trading behavior (Engelberg and Parsons, 2011), cash flow (Drake et al., 2014), a nd market pricing efficiency (Twedt, 2016). However, there are no combined qualitative and quantitative studies that study the impact of Nomophobia and I -FoMO on investors‘ investment decisions. In order to investigate whether there is an impact of Nomopho bia on retail investors‘ decisions by incorporating the mediating effects of I -FoMO, the present study offers a novel approach in interdisciplinary studies of behavioural finance, marketing and media studies. The major objectives of the study are: (a) to i nvestigate the impact of Nomophobia on retail investors‘ decision making in financial market and (b) to analyse the mediating effects of I -FoMO between the relationship of Nomophobia and Investor behaviour in Indian Financial markets.   The rest of the pap er is organized as follows. Section two provides theoretical framework and conceptual model under the head of Literature Review. Section three presents research methods and techniques applied to investigate the phenomenon. Section four presents data analys is and results of the study. Section five explains the theoretical and managerial implications followed by limitations of the study and the directions for future research.   LITERATURE REVIEW  Theoretical Framework  In behavioural finance, there are many biases which investors tends to exhibit while incorporating their investment decisions in any financial market. Human beings are generally called as social animals and thus possess an inherent bias commonly followed in financial market is called as Herd Behaviour
	. In any capital market, investors exhibit behaviour where they follow groups to avoid any predatory activities, which might land them up in financial loss (Baddeley, 2010; Kumar and Goyal, 2015; Spyrou, 2013). In this regard, the most common tool u sed is a mobile (smart) phone to gather information either through social media pages, brokers, investment advisors‘ tips, and many other platforms to keep them updated. The continued usage of smartphone for generating 
	4  information is useful also, but makin g investors addictive to compulsory checking habits too (Chiu, 2014; Lee, 2014). Thus, in case the mobile phone is lost or in any working day and investor does not possess this vital organ for taking strong and bold investment decisions, the investors migh t represent a distressed and depressed behaviour and can lead for higher anxiety levels full of fear and irrational decisions. This phenomenon was addressed in detail by 20 -item Nomophobia questionnaire (NMP -Q) by Yildirim and Correia (2015). The present s tudy is adopting this 20 -item NMP -Q to investigate the fact that how much it has an impact on investors‘ decision making and contributing to herd behaviour in financial market. The scenario of Nomophobia corroborates the findings of Compensatory Internet U se Theory (Kardefelt -Winther, 2014), where people go for online transactions to alleviate negative feelings and adverse life situations caused by an addition, that is, no -mobile -phones and investment decisions.   The another aspect in the present study is Investor Fear of Missing Out (I -FoMO), where investors are largely effected by the information disseminated by mobile devise applications on non -professional investors‘ decisions (Clor -Pronell et al., 2019). The I -FoMO scale is different from the traditiona l FOMO scale that exists in social media setting as proposed by Przybylski et al. (2013). The scale developed in I -FoMO states that mobile phones have a direct relationship with the investment decisions of retail investors and varies under different zones of I-FoMO. The presence of I -FoMO can also trigger overtrading in terms of speculative activities as to satisfy greed or to reduce the future grief of losing vital investment, the investors tends to exhibit the biases of ―Hot Hand‖ fallacy and Gamblers‘ fa llacy succumbing to Wobegon Lake effect in financial market (Maciejewski and Lesznik, 2020). Thus, the theoretical foundations of the present study is based on Nomophobia (Yildirim and Correia, 2015) leading to diverse investors decisions (Livanas, 2011; M aciejewski and Lesznik, 2020; Shiva and Singh, 2019) under the scenario of Investor FoMO (I -FoMO) scale as developed by Clor -Pronell et al., 2019.   The role of Investor FoMO as a mediator is thoroughly investigated in this study to give new insights in th e existing literature especially in a developing economy like India comprised of second largest population of the world.  Conceptual Model  The mobile phones have become a part of life for not only the younger generations, but also for people of all age grou ps, who are now dependent on the mobile phones for their daily needs. There are smartphone applications for almost everything to sustain daily life through communication, recreation, entertainment, education, and social media, and for catching up with the latest developments in today‘s world (Alfawareh and Jusoh, 2014). With an increased dependence on the mobile phones, many negative impacts have also been noticed due to the excessive use of mobile phones, which include reduced concentration and focus (Alt,  2015), increased loneliness and depression (Casey, 2012; Gezgin et al., 2018), and sleep disorders (Demirci et al., 2015; Gezgin, 2018; Hughes and Burke, 2018; Lemola et al., 2015). This has resulted in two major behavioural issues among the users of mobi le phone, Nomophobia and FOMO.   Nomophobia and Investor Behaviour  The Nomophobia is the anxiety syndrome related to the non -availability of the mobile phone (King et al., 2014). People get panic attacks in the fear of staying away from their mobile phones , and in getting out of the network coverage area or out of battery power. These panic attacks can lead to complex behavioural patterns seen in the Nomophobic individuals, including frequently checking their mobile phones, not paying enough attention to th e present situation around them, and depression in the long run
	. Several studies have been conducted in the past to understand these behavioural patterns in the Nomophobic individuals, especially focusing on the younger generations‘ performance in studies (Burucuo glu, 2017; Durak, 2018; Erdem et al., 2016; Gezgin, 2017; Gezgin and C akır, 2016; Gezgin et al., 2018; Gezgin et al., 2017; Sırakaya, 2018; Yıldırım et al., 2016). Thus, similar phenomenon can be investigated for Nomophobia on investor behaviour c aused by lack of information in financial markets (Saft, 2015; Wadhwa, 2017 especially in the importance of media‘s role for information dissemination in capital markets causing information asymmetry (Bushee et al., 
	5  2010; Clor -Pronell et al., 2019; Engelbe rg and Parsons, 2011; Miller and Skinner, 2015). On these premise, we hypothesize that:   H1: Nomophobia influences investment decisions of the retail investors.   I-FoMO and Investor Behaviour  The FOMO syndrome is related to the fear and anxiety of missing out on important information and developments through not being connected to the social media all the time (Przybylski et al., 2013). People with FOMO syndrome also suffer from panic attacks, as they check their mobile phones frequently to continuously upd ate themselves with the latest developments in the social environment (for example, family, friends, and places around them) (Franchina et al., 2018; Przybylski et al., 2013; VandenAbeeleand and Van Rooij, 2016). Therefore, the behavioural patterns of FOMO  individuals are very similar to the Nomophobic individuals, and both suffer from mood swings, and lower levels of satisfaction with life (Przybylski et al., 2013). Studies conducted on FOMO individuals also found a strong correlation between excessive use of social media and high levels of stress, and fear of loneliness (Beyens et al., 2016).   The retail investors in India are also making their investment decisions through mobile phone applications. A recent survey of investors indicates that the younger i nvestors are making almost all their investment decisions through mobile phone applications (Shana et al., 2019). This is because of the availability of large number of investment applications on mobile devices and easy access to the real -time market infor mation (Brown et al., 2015). The dependence of retail investors on mobile phones for making their investment decisions has also resulted in more retail investors having Nomophobic and FOMO syndrome (Saft 2015; Wadhwa 2017), and these individuals find it di fficult to ignore interruptions in investment information (Basoglu et al., 2009). In the past literature, the FOMO related to the investment information has been given a distinct identity (I -FoMO), to make it different from the traditional FOMO related to the social information (Shana et al., 2019). Past studies have found that I -FoMO is more effective in retail investors decision making if received in smaller pieces with breaks in between (Kupor and Tormala, 2015). The length and delivery mechanism of the investment information (email and text alerts) release also has an impact on I -FoMO retail investors (Blankespoor et al., 2018). On these premises, we posit next two hypotheses:   H2: Nomophobia influences the I -FoMO behaviour of the retail investors, and  H3: I -FoMO influences the investment decisions of retail investors.   Mediating Role of I -FoMO  The literature on the behaviour of Nomophobia and FOMO individuals has been building rapidly (Shana et al., 2019). The majority of the studies are based on the quantitative design models, where the focus is to identify the variables leading to the symptoms of Nomophobia and FOMO among individual investors (Miller and Skinner, 2015). FOMO has been investigated in many studies where mediation effects are documented in  many studies (Abel et al., 2016; Alt, 2015; Beyens et al., 2016; Buglass et al., 2017; Oberst et al., 2017; Przylylski et al., 2013).    However, there are no qualitative studies to our knowledge, which focus on how the behavioural patterns among Nomophob ia and I-FoMO individuals impact the investment decisions of retail investors (Basoglu et al., 2009; Clor -proell et al., 2019; Schuur, 2017). Our study fills that gap using a conceptual model that integrates qualitative and quantitative data. As more and m ore retail investors fall into this category of Nomophobia and I -FoMO individuals, it is important to understand how their investment information, obtained through the use of mobile phones, impacts their investment decisions. The retail investors‘ investme nt behaviour further affects capital markets, market information asymmetry, trading behavior, cash flow, and market pricing efficiency ( Shana et al
	., 2019 ). The results of our study fill the gap in literature through an understanding of the individual reta il investors‘ behaviour, who have been exposed to these two negative concepts (Nomophobia and FOMO), using an interpretation of the quantitative and qualitative findings. Thus, we focus on seeking an answer to the hypotheseswhether Nomophobia and/or FOMO b ehaviour positively influences the investment decisions of the retail investors, and if FOMO mediates the relationship 
	6  between the Nomophobia and investment decisions by the retail investors. Thus we propose another hypothesis:  H4: I -FoMO mediates the relationship between the Nomophobia and investment decisions by the retail investors.  The study would be incomplete with the control variables and it for this reason, the literature review suggested the under the Investor FoMO environment on investor decisions in a financial market, vital factors like age, gender and education of investors play a pivotal role in both investment decisions and  I -FoMO (Alt and Boniel -Nissim, 2018; Przybylski et al., 2013). Thus, by controlling the effects of age, gender and education of retail investors, the impact of Nomophobia and I -FoMO on investors‘ decisions were investigated and the proposed conceptual model was shown in Figure 1.  RESEARCH METHODOLOGY  The present study was condu cted on the major financial markets located in Mumbai and Delhi. Further data was collected from other major cities of India to represent the behaviour of Indian investor by an online questionnaire due to the lockdown imposed during the months of March to May 2020. Online survey was conducted by applying non -probability purposive sampling method to collect data through a questionnaire as mentioned in Appendix – 1. The questionnaire was adapted from the 20 item explored by Yildirim and Correia(2015) in order  to validate the constructs of Nomophobia, and from Clor -Proell et al.(2019),Przybylski et al.(2013, p.1841) for Investment related Fear of Missing Out 10 item construct (I -FOMO). Finally, the construct of investment decision was obtained from the studies of Livanas (2011), Shiva and Singh (2019), and Maciejewsk i and Lesznik (2020). All items were measured on a 7 -point scale ranging from 1 – 7, representing strongly disagree to strongly agree.    In total, 265 correct responses were received and used for final analysis by Partial Least Square Structural Equationa l Modelling (PLS -SEM) in SmartPLS Software 3.3.2 version. PLS – SEM is considered as a preferred method in this analysis since the conceptual model contains the construct of Nomophobia, which is a second order construct to be assessed by formative modellin g. Further, where the model consists of reflective and formative modelling, then PLS -SEM in SmartPLS offers higher flexibility in such complex models and thus is widely accepted multivariate analytical method (Hair et al., 2017; Hair et al., 2019; Nitzl et  al., 2016; Richter et a., 2016; Rigdon, 2016; Ringle et al., 2014; Ringle et al. 2015; Hair et al., 2020). We have applied the PLS -SEM approach to study the impacts of Nomophobia and I -FoMO on investors‘ behaviour towards  Figure1: Proposed Conceptual Model   
	7  their investment decisions.  The s ample size was determined by applying G*Power software 3.1.9.7 version in order to investigate the minimum required sample size (Faul et al., 2007; 2009). The actual power of 0.95 was duly obtained by a minimum sample size of 226 respondents, whereas the s tudy used a sample size of 265 which satisfies the appropriate sample size requirements. The minimum sample size estimations are reported in Figure 2.   Finally, Harma n‘ single factor analysis was applied to investigate whether any Common Method Bias exist in the study. In this process, all statements were loaded to single factor and the results revealed that there is a total of 34.007percent variance, which is below th e threshold maximum limit of 50 percent variance, recommending no common method bias in the study (Babin et al., 2016; Podsakoff et al., 2003).   RESULTS  Descriptive Analysis  The descriptive statistics of the study are well reported in Table 1. All surveyed investors were actively engaged in the investment decisions related to buying and selling of stock. The demographic figures show that majority are males (53.2%), young inves tors (74.3%), well -educated (52.1%) and experienced (57.9%) for investing money in stock with a good deal of risk appetite (55.1%).    Measurement Model Assessments  The study investigated outer model specifications applying internal reliability and conver gent validity checks of the model.

	8  partial least square structural Equational modelling, the study used Confirmatory Composite Analysis (CCA), whereby Nomophobia was investigated by reflective -formative measurement assessments as proposed by Yildirim an d Correia(2015). In the first stage of Two -Stage reflective -formative assessments, first the latent variable scores of all four dimensions of Nomophobia were assessed by applying Mode A. Then the scores of first order constructs were applied to measure the  second -order construct in a formative mode in the second stage. Therefore, second -order composite was designed to investigate the impact on I -FOMO and investment decisions of retail investors in the study(Schuberth, Henseler and Dijkstra, 2018; Nitzl et a l., 2020).  All internal reliability checks were investigated through Cronbach‘s Alpha, Dijkstra and Henseler‘srhoA, Composite Reliability  (CR) which were above the threshold limit of 0.70 (Ali et al., 2018; Hair et al., 2017; 2020). The Cronbach‘s Alpha for No convenience construct was below the value of 0.70; however the value of rho A was  sufficiently above the limit of 0.70 to establish the reliability of the constructs. (Hair et al., 2019). The convergent validity was also established with average variance extracted (AVE) score, which were sufficiently above the threshold value of 0.50 a nd above for all the Table 1: Sample demographics (N=265)  Age Frequency  Percent  Educational Qualification  Frequency  Percent  Below 30  197 74.3 Graduate  77 29.1 30-39 44 16.5 Post Graduate  138 52.1 Above 40  24 9.1 Professional  50 18.8  265 100  265 100       Gender    Trading Experience    Male  141 53.2 Up to 5 year  114 43.1 Female  124 46.8 6 - 10 years  69 26.1  265 100 Above 10 years  82 31.8     265 100 Income    Risk Aversion    Below 30000 p.m.  113 43.80  Risk Averse  119 44.9 30000 – 50000 p.m.  110 42.64  Risk Lover  146 55.1 Above 50000 p.m.  35 13.56   265 100  258 100    Marital Status       Married  178 67.2    Unmarried  87 32.8     265 100    Source: Author‟s Calculations

The study further investigated discriminant validity with the help of Fornell and Larcker‘s Criterion (1981) whereby the under root of AVEs of the constructs on the diagonal was higher than their inter -item correlation values.

In addition to the traditional method of investigating discriminant validity of the constructs, a new criterion of Heterotrait -Monotrait ratio of correlations (HTMT) is also used in this study. As per the latest criterion, all HTMT values must be less than 1 as suggested by HTMT inference  method, however to be on a stricter  note  Heterotrait -Monotrait (HTMT) Ratio of correlations with a maximum ratio of 0.85 (Henseler et al., 2015; Voorhees et al., 2016) and 0.9 permissible value (Gold et al., 2001). In this study, the HTMT values were exceeding beyond 0.90 in case of the co nstructs of No convenience and I -FOMO for which HTMT inference  was applied to establish discriminant validity on a liberal side. Similar treatment was provided for the constructs of No connection and No access where the HTMT value was 0.924, however the confidence intervals for HTMT inference were well within the limits, thereby establishing the uniqueness of all the constructs as per the empirical standards as represented in Table 4.   Structural Model Assessments  The relationship between the constructs and their predictive relevance were examined in structural model assessments (Hair et al., 2017). The process was conducted with the bootstrapping process with recommended 5000 bootstraps without sign change in order to find out the required p -values for the hypotheses framed in the study (Hair et al., 2020).  Firstly, in the structural inner model, each set of he predictor constructs are assessed separately by considering them as a formative measurement models (Cassel et al., 1999). It is for this purpose, tole rance and Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) values were calculated, which were found to be below 3.33 (Diamantopoulos et al., 2008).  The inner VIFs were found to be below the threshold limits with Investment FOMO (2.234) and Nomophobia (2.234) on Investment  Decisions to report that no collinearity issues were involved in the study (Hair et al., 2017). After investigating for any collinearity issues in the inner model, the next step was to check the significance and relevance of the path coefficients, which c ould have varied between -1 to +1 by following the bootstrapping process with 5000 subsamples in PLS Algorithm. In the structural model, Nomophobia was assessed as a second -order composite for which latent variable scores of four reflective constructs were  considered as a formative assessment. The outer weights of all second – order composite were found to be significant at 1 percent level and different from zero (Van Riel et al., 2017; Henseler, 2017; Muller et al., 2018; Nitzl, 2020).

	11  endogenous construct investment decision was found be significantly moderate to high at 50.1 percent. In behavioural sciences, any value of R20.20 and above is considered to be high (Rasoolimanesh et al., 2017), and it this study investment decisions of retail investors are significantly determined by Nomophobia and I -FOMO. Further, the goodness of fit criterion was investigated by the Standardised root mean s quare residual (SRMR) global fit indices.   In present times of research with PLS –SEM Models, a global model fit index like SRMR is vital to evaluate the goodness of it model (Hair et al., 2020). The study shows SRMR value of 0.067 in the model and is well below the threshold value of 0.08 to indicate that the model under the study had a good explanatory power (Henseler et al., 2016; Hu and Bentler, 1999).  The structural model assessment and hypot heses testing is well explained by Table 5.   Table 5 results revealed that Nomophobia is the most prominent feature which positively influence I -FoMO by the investors to make investment decision in stock trading in financial market (β=0.746, p< 0.001), thereby supporting H2.   The second most important impact was found  Figure 4: Structural Model Assessments with control variables   Table 5: Structural Model Assessments  Hypothesis  Path Relationships  Std.

	12  to be from Nomophobia on investment decisions as reported by the investors in trading decision of stock purchases (β=0.485, p<0.001), thus supported H1. Next, investors under study  exhibited that one I -FoMO is experienced by them then it leads to immediate investment decisions in financial market (β=0.265, p<0.001) and also supported H3.   Further, all control variables are found to be insignificant in the present study as the resul ts are not supported at 5 percent. However, some inferences can still be drawn where investors above the age of 40 years are engaged in investment decisions whereas younger investors are more prone to I -FoMO. In addition to this, males are more prone to execute the investment decisions in comparison to females, whereas females are more likely to bear the fright of I -FoMO in financial markets. In terms of education, highly educated investor are driving their investment decisions carefully, whereas less educa ted investors are more likely to exhibit I -FoMO.      The predictive importance and relevance were tested through the effect size (f2) and (Q2) of the proposed model. The proposed limits of investigating the change in R2 due to the impact of exogenous cons tructs on endogenous constructs are 0.02 (small effects), 0.15 (moderate effects) and 0.35 (large effects) (Cohen, 1988). In this study, I -FoMO (f2=0.061) discloses weak effect size on Investment Decisions, however Nomophobia (f2=0.206) is the most importa nt composite which is responsible for explaining the endogenous variable of trading frequency in financial markets by retail investors. Lastly, predictive relevance of the structural model with second -order composite of Nomophobia and I -FOMO and Investment  Decisions were investigated by Stone -Geisser‘s Q2 as was found to be 0.284 for Investment Decisions representing with a moderate predictive relevance of the model (Geisser, 1975; Stone, 1974).   Any value above 0.02 can be used to generalise the results l ater on and have sufficient predictive power (Richter et al., 2016). The Stone -Geisser‘s Q2 for I -FoMO was also found to be 0.270 which concludes that both independent constructs are important in the conceptual model of the study and the results can be gen eralised in different contexts ahead in future.     Importance Performance Map Analysis (IMPA)  In order to further strengthen the results of constructs under study, we have applied priority map analysis which is also termed as impact -performance map or imp ortance performance matrix (Ringle and Sarstedt, 2016). The key objective of applying IMPA in this study is to identify which of the Scale, that is, Nomophobia or I -FoMO is important to shape up the performance of target construct of investment decisions ( Fornell et al., 1996; Martilla and James, 1977; Ringle and Sarstedt, 2016; Slack, 1994). In this process the strong total effects towards the target construct were identified with a relatively high important construct in the study. IMPA is more suitably applied when there are mediators in the study and especially where there are complex mediation effects (Direct effects + Indirect Effects= Total Effects) with the help of Variance Accounted For (VAF) method.   Table: 6 Importance – Performance Map (Construct  wise unstandardized effects)  Constructs  Importance  Performance  Nomophobia  0.262  76.199  Investment FoMO  0.747  79.711  Mean Value  0.5045  77.955  Source: Authors‘ Calculations   In Table Number 6, we have investigated Construct Total Effects of Nomophobia and  I –FoMOon Investment Decisions for the unstandardized effects to facilitate the ceteris paribus interpretation of predecessor constructs‘ impact. The unstandardized effects are exactly similar to the unstandardized weights of Ordinary Least Square Regression modelling (Hair et al., 2010). The performance of the construct Investment Decisions is calculated as 77
	.562. In order to report the IMPA results, the direct effects, ind irect effects and the total effects of antecedents on the consequent construct Investment decision is calculate by Variance Accounted For (VAF) by investigating the mediation effects.   The results of IMPA are reported in Table 7 as below:  
	13  The basic condition was also met that all indicators were having significant loading and weights and were all positive (Ringle and Sarstedt, 2016) to apply IMPA. The four quadrants were derived successfully based on the mean values of importance and perfor mance values of the constructs.   In figure 5, one unit change in Nomophobia performance from 79.711 to 80.711 would enhance the performance of investment decisions from 77.562 to 78.242 with a total effect of 0.683. Further, for one unit increase from 76.199 to 77.199 in the performance i n I-FoMO would raise the performance of Investment Decisions from 77.562 to 77.821. Therefore, out of the two predecessors of the dependent variables towards Investment Decisions, the most striking and important construct is Nomophobia which relatively more important construct in the four quadrants in the figure number 5 and would have more impact on the performance of Investment decisions of retail investors. Therefore, financial advisors, telecommunication industry, opinion makers and especially the media  industry should critically look into the aspect of Nomophobia where lack of information in mobile phones would impact the mind of retail investors for erratic investment decision while making the investment decisions (Mirchandani and Gaur, 2019; Malik and  Narula, 2019).      DISCUSSION AND THEORETICAL IMPLICATIONS  The major aim of the study was to investigate the impact of Nomophobia on the retail investor decision making in the financial market. The study confirms the belief that without mobile the fear of missing a vital information from the stock market would be very high. The relationship of Nomophobia on I-FoMO is extremely high in the Indian financial markets and the results are in line with the scale validation conducted by Clor -Proell et al., 2019.  In media studies, technology and media do have considerable impact on investors‘ reactions and the behaviour is different for the normal decisions primarily accounting for speculative decisions (Cade, 2018; Guggenmos and Bennett, 2018; Brown et al., 2019) . The study is in line with the theory of compensatory internet use theory to exhibit the aspect of gamblers‘ fallacy by doing overtrading in the absence of information asymmetry caused by Nomophobia. Thus, this line of argument is providing value to the Table: 7 Direct, Indirect and Total effects  Predecessor Constructs  Direct Effects on Investment Decisions  Indirect Effects on Investment Decisions  Total Effects on Investment Decisions  Significance of Total Effects?

	14  existing literature where Nomophobia is accounting for the behavioural biases like herd behaviour and gambler‘s fallacy to account for excessive trade. Secondly, the scale developed by Clor -Proell et al. (2019) for I -FoMO is duly established and validated i n this study to justify its impact on investment decisions in financial market (Basoglu et al., 2009; Schuur, 2017) and the phenomenon is altogether different from the traditional FOMO (Przybylski et al., 2013). Lastly, the aspect of investors‘ decision ma king options are duly validated in the present study (Maciejewski and Lesznik, 2020; Shiva and Singh, 2019). The proposed conceptual model can add value to the domain of behavioural finance where Nomophobia is considered to be an important construct couple d with I -FoMO yielding for investor biases.   Managerial Implications  The predictive relevance of I -FoMO was found to be moderate in this study thereby indicating that in diverse context and in difference financial markets, similar results might occur to represent the investor behaviour. The IMPA has further added a very importance dimension for the investment advisors, brokers, telecommunication companies and corporates to see that smartphones are the key ingredients and considered to be an inseparable par t of human lives these days where lot of information can be fuelled to keep the investors engaged in the quality decisions. Further, in case investors face issues like fear, anxiety or exhibit irrational decisions, the same can be corrected by information symmetries by smartphones in financial markets. The aspect of I -FoMO is completely different from traditional FOMO and thus is more related to monetary gains to the investor by regulating the information and news provided by media agencies to their respect ive clients. The present study also caters to the psychologists to identify the additive behaviour of investors to their smartphones and can suggest way and means to rectify this erratic behaviour, but the cost of monetary gains.   LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE R ESEARCH DIRECTIONS  The present study does possess certain limitations in the study, which accounts for other aspects of investor behaviour especially in the domain of behavioural finance. More constructs can be added to the existing model since the propose d model is a modest attempt to link the aspect of Nomophobia to investor behaviour. Further, the study can be conducted in South East Asian markets to investigate whether similar results are obtained by the investors, although the predictive relevance of t he present model is good. The role of personality can be investigated ahead in this model where the moderation effects can provide diverse results for extrovert and introvert investors as has been tested for the traditional FOMO.

Gustavo Hermínio  Salati Marcondes de Moraes,  School of Applied Sciences, University of Campinas (UNICAMP)  Limeira – Sao Paulo, Brazil   Gisela Consolmagno Pelegrini  School of Applied Sciences, University of Campinas (UNICAMP)  Limeira - Sao Paulo, Brazil   Gabriela Trindade Pinheiro  School of Applied Sciences, University of Campinas (UNICAMP)  Limeira - Sao Paulo, Brazil   ABSTRACT   Social media allows people to organize themselves and take action against social injustices and policies. Used to spread information, social media has been linked to the dissemination of political protests around the world. Relying on the Theory of Planned Behavior and Herd Behavior, this studied aimed at identifying gender differences in social network protests‘ participati on. Making use of multivariate data analysis through Partial Least Squares Path Modeling (PLS -SEM), 318 Brazilians responded the study and the results indicate that there are differences between the relationships of the antecedents of the use of the social  network between users of different genders. The differences are in the relationship between the attitude and the use of social networks to participate in protests, with a positive effect on men and negative on women. This means that men understand that participating in online protests through social networks can improve awareness of events, giving strength to the movement and helping to ease the tension of protests, while women do not. The results go beyond the studies on which they were based, including t he gender multigroup analysis and presenting a new model of technological adoption with new elements, such as the herd behavior, embracing the imitation, and the uncertainty constructs. There is also a contribution to a greater understanding of the influen ce of social media on collective activism or movements.   Keywords : Social Media, Online Movements, Protests, Gender .  INTRODUCTION  Media is a powerful tool for communication and socialization (Fong et al., 2019) . It has an important effect on perceived public opinion  about the reality and it also allows dominant groups into shaping individuals‘ values, attitudes and opinions (Fong et al., 2019; Gitlin, 1980) .Social media, for that matter,not only presents itself as a real -time intelligence tool to get busin ess insights (Mirchandani & Gaur, 2019)  but also as an enabler for individuals to g ather themselves and take action against social injustices and policies rapidly  (Lance Bennett & Seger berg, 2011) . It enables individuals to mobilize others into taking part, either in a short or longlength, turning it into a challenge the persistence of these movements (Selander & Jarvenpaa, 2016) .  Faceboo k and Twitter are often considered as both disruptive and nondisruptive platforms that could shape political participation (Jost et al., 2018) . Social media analysis enables opportunities to observe collective action and social movements behaviors (Jost et al. , 2018) . According toJost et al. (2018) , social media use has been linked to the spread of political protests i n several countries around the world (Hong Kong, Moscow, Kiev, Madrid, New York, Los Angeles, among others). This paper aims at identifying gender differences in social media protests‘ participation. The results may provide relevant information regarding o nline movements against social injustices, showing beliefs and the differences regarding the participants‘ motivations towards these  movements.   
	23  The comprehension of online communities and behavior is relevant once it may affect real-world outcomes and it also reflects on how citizens look for information and how they relate to media (Batista et al., 2017) . In Latin America,  online gender is a trend, especially when hashtags are analyzed (Batista et al., 2017) . According to Batista et al., (2017) , most trendy hashtags in 2015 among Brazilian userswere marked by gender issues (e.g. #Feminism #ViolenceCannotBeJustified, #Feminist, #SpeakWithoutFear) and also a political hashtag, such as the one in favor of firing the ex -president of Federal Chamber, in Federal Supreme Court (Batista et al., 2017) .  Around the globe, studies on females‘ representativeness online behavior has been pointed as sparse (Fong et al., 2019) , as women‘s participation in protests (regarding females‘ rights and also other subjects) are also unde r-researched (Roth & Saunder s, 2019) , this paper intends to fill in the research gap, presenting an analysis of differences regarding the subject in Brazil.This article is structured in five chapters. The next section presents the theoretical background divided in three subjects, followed by the methodology,hypotheses, and results of the research. Afterward, adiscussionwith conclusions, limitations, and opportunities for future studies are going to be exposed.   LITERATURE REVIEW   This chapter presents a literature review on the mai n topics of this research, as it is structures: (2.1) Activism and Movements through Social Media, introducing studies about movements through social network and the current significance,  (2.2) Behavior Theories Related to Information Technology, in which is presented theoretical behavior model supporting the technological information  and (2.3) Females‘ use of Social Media presenting gender participation in this manner of activism.   Activism and movements through social media  Social media engage an importan t role in information diffusion, mainly referring to online social movements, connecting people promptly (Isa & Himelboim, 2018) , and has proved to be very potent in many situations (Howard et al. , 2011; Hughes & Palen, 2009) , attracting the attention of researches (Boyd & Ellison, 2007) .  The online social movem ents are heterogeneous due to the different modes of strategies and actions developed by the social actors and their particular reasons for participation (Passy & Giugni, 2001) , and can be understood as the popular access to claiming their rights or even as the participation in the democratic process of public policies according to a specific context.   As an effective tool for activists and social movements, it provides human interaction resulting in successful outcomes, such as the movement to free Al Jazeera journalists imprisoned by Egyptian authorities between 2013 and 2015 (Isa & Himelboim, 2018) , the impac t on the Arab Spring between 2014 and 2016 (Howard et al. , 2011),mass convergence to manage emergencies in the politic field (Hughes & Palen, 2009) or social movements, as My Stealthy Freedom against the compulsory veiling of women in Iran (Stewart & Schultze, 2019) , among others.   However, the u se of social networks does not assure the success of the movements. The results of a study carried out to identify factors that led people to use social media to participate in the protests that occurred in 2013 in Brazil demonstrated disbelief about any p ositive effect on solving problems. Nevertheless, the intended to continue protesting virtually remained (Moraes et al. , 2018) .  Behavior theories related to information technology  To identify factors that led people to use social networks to participate in the social movements, a model has been developed based on some theories and constructs used in the Information Technology (IT) area, in the technological adoption field.   The Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) proposes that an individual behavior is determined by the person's intention to perform a behavior and, consequently, this intention is determined by the attitude towards the behavior and the subjective norms (Fishbein & Ajzen, 1975) 
	. Therefo re, it is necessary to understand the individual beliefs as well as the environmental context, 
	24  determinants of the normative, and attitude components (Fishbein & Ajzen, 1975) .  The Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) was developed as an extension of TRA, adding the perceived behavioral control construct, which influences both intention and behavior (Ajzen, 1991) . The relative importance of attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control in predicting intention fluctuate accord ing to the different situations to which the theory is applied.   According to TPB, human behavior is based on behavioral beliefs, that is the possible consequences of human behavior leading to a favorable or unfavorable behavioral attitude, on normative be liefs, which would be the social pressure on behavior, and also on beliefs about control, referring to factors that can facilitate or impede the performance of the individual's behavior (Ajzen, 1991) .    The behavioral attitude concerns, in this work, to the respondent's understanding about the possibility of their participation in an online social movement contributing to better awareness about the subject, strengthening the movement, contributing to the current debate, and increasing the importance of social actions. Beliefs about control, in this present study, refer to the perception of ease or difficulty in using social networ ks to participate in protests and activism, as post, share and comment posts about movements.   In contrast, the subjective norm construct was not considered the most appropriate for this research (Krueger et al. , 2000) , and constructs referring to research on Herd Behavior (HB) toward  the use of IT (Walden & Browne, 2009)  were used to replace these values. Researches about HB have been carried out in different situations, such as the downloading software applications (Duan et al. , 2009; Moraes, 2016; Walden & Browne, 2009) , and the development of television programs (Kennedy, 2003) , and, in g eneral, two primary conditions are necessary for the occurrence of HB: uncertainty about the own decision and observation of the others' actions.   Females‟ use of Social Media  The use of internet and social networks for political or social engagement has attracted researchers‘ attention in the past decades (Schuster, 2013) . Discussions approach how online activism could actually reach the real world (Livingstone et al. , 2005) , other even points that Facebook accounts have been disregarded when it comes to political participation (Christensen, 2011; Schuster, 2013) . While several researches suggest many ways on how social media can impact on collective action (Selander & Jarvenpaa, 2016; Valenzuela, 2013; Valenzuela et al. , 2016) , few has dedicated efforts to understand females‘ behavior regarding protests participation (Loiseau & Nowacka, 2015; Schuster, 2017) .  Social media has proved itself as a powerful tool to bring females‘ interests and rights to public knowledge (Loiseau & Nowacka, 2015) . The unprecedented use of social media by women represents an important ste p to bring opportunities and several discussions regarding (in)equality, gender gap, among others into media attention (Loiseau & Nowacka, 2015) .  Easy access and low in cost, online participation in protests is a preference for many young women, especially the ones who lack of resources, furthermore, this option enables a choice regarding how m uch of their identity will be exposed (Schuster, 2013) .  In Brazil, political movements in 2013 wer e marked by a strong online engagement and participation, which brought a different way of making protests in the country (Queiroz, 2017) , during 2018s presidential election, females created the world fam ous hashtag #EleNão (#NotHim) (Baronas et al. , 2019) .   Regarding females‘ participation on online activism, the literature points to a wave of feminist forces trying to direct efforts into transforming online social movements i nto actual change: the Feminist fourth wave (Hollanda, 2018) 
	. According to the author (Hollanda, 2018) , this new wave would be marked by the intense use of social media as important vectors of change.   Accordingly, it is within the online environment where women organize themselves and take a stand against abuse, gender discrimination, by developing a suppo rt network, where it is possible toshare stories and testimonials, and also organizing campaigns, social actions and protests 
	25  (Madsen, 2015) . Differently from previous decades, the internet and social media enable a much broader capability o f information dissemination, where people could get information and also debate their ideas (Madsen, 2015) .  On the other hand, previous research on females‘ behavior towards political engagementpoints to evidence that women engagein less vi sible political behaviors on social media because they are more likely to use social media for relationship maintenance and seem to be able to overcome political's confrontations and exposure (Bode, 2017) .  METHODOLOGY  The research was developed through a quantitative methodology, with the use of multivariate data analysis. Due to social movements online theories are less developed and the objectives are the constructs hereby presented, Partial Least Squares Path Modelin g (PLS -SEM) was chosen to reach this paper‘s objectives (Hair et al. , 2017) .   The preliminary questionnaire was evaluated by a group composed by 5 specialists in Information Technology area, who had already used models of technology adoption to asses content validity of the statements (Netemeyer et al. , 2003) . Five potential respondents were used to perform a pre -test with the questionnaire. Scales were adapted from previous studies.The questionnaire was posted in social media through a link in groups of social movements. The sample accounted with 318 respondents, on ce others were discarded due to incomplete answers. As recommended by the literature (Chin & Newsted, 199 9), to evaluate sample‘s size and statistic power, G* Power 3.1.5 was used (Cohen, 1988) . Considering the predictors, significance level of 5%, statistical power of 0.8 and average effect size (f² = 0.15, which is equivalent to r² = 13%), we have that the minimum sample size is of 77. As the sample was 318 respondents, it is suitable for estimation by PLS -PM.  The sample included 55% of mal e respondents, and 45% of female respondents. Most respondents were young, aged between 16 and 19 years old (50%). 30% were 20 and 29 years old and the remaining 20% were over 30 years old.   The post hoc analyzes for the sample obtained indicate that: (a)  any r² greater than 3.35% would be detected as significant, maintaining the power of 0.8 and a significance level of 5%; and (b) for the medium effect size, the power is 0.999, which is well above the recommended value of 0.8  (Hair et al. , 2017) .The SmartPLS 3.0M3 software (Ringle et al. , 2015)  was used for calculations and validations of statistical tests.   HYPOTHESES  This paper had as an objective to identify gender differences in protest‘s participation through social media. Therefore , the main hypothesis for this research is described as follows:   Hypothesis 1: There are differences between the relationships of the antecedents of behavior of using social networks to protest among users of different genders.  In this context, the paper‘s sub -hypotheses were developed based on the main theories in the area of information technology that were related to the focus of the research.  The first two sub -hypotheses of the study were based on TPB:  Hypothesis 1a: There are gender differences in the relationship between attitude towards behavior and the use of social networks to participate in protests.  Hypothesis 1b: There are gender differences in the relationship between perceived behavioral control and the use of soci al networks to participate in protests.   The third and fourth sub -hypotheses of the study are related to herd behavior when using IT:  Hypothesis 1c: There are gender differences in the relationship between imitation and the use of social networks to parti cipate in protests.  Hypothesis 1d: There are gender differences in the relationship between uncertainty and imitation.  Figure 1 presents the conceptual model of research:   
	26  It is acknowledging  the existence of other influential factors on the use of social network and protests‘ participations online, however, the hypotheses presented in this paper show a broader relationship to the chosen object of study.   RESULTS ANALYSIS  The model's indicators are reflective, and the criteria for evaluation are: internal consistency, reliability of the indicator, convergent validity and discriminant validity (Hair et al. , 2017) .  The discriminant and convergent validities were assessed at the level of indicators and latent variables. In the analysis of crossed factor loads, all indicators showed high factor loads in their latent variables, greater than 0.70, and low in the other latent variables.  Another indicator used for convergent validation of the model is the value of the average variance extracted (AVE), which, as a criterion for validation, must present a value greater than 0.5 (Hair et al. , 2017) .  To assess the measurement model, the composite reliability of each construct  was also used (Hair et al. , 2017). To analyze the convergent validity, the internal consistency was verified. Another indicator of discriminant validity between the constructs is to calculate the square root of the average variance extracted from the cons tructs. Table 1 presents these values, the square root of the average variance extracted is shown in bold diagonally, this value must be greater than the correlation between the latent variables (Fornell & Larcker, 1981) . Table 1 presents all the indicators mentioned and shows that all values are within the limits established by the authors.

	27  Before evaluating the structural model, it is necessary to assess the collinearity of the structural model. To assess collinearity, the VIF values were analyzed for each subpart of the structural model. All values are within the established, below 5 (Hair et al. , 2017).   To analyze the meanings of the indicators, a bootstrapping technique was used (Efron  & Tibshirani, 1998) . A Student‘s T test analyzes a hypothesis that the correlation coefficients are equal to zero. If the results of this test indicate values greater than 1.96, a rejected hypothesis and significant correlation (Efron & Tibshirani, 1998; Hair et al., 2017) .  Table 2 presents the coefficients of the structural model. The relationships are imposed by the values of the construction coefficients and as Student‘s T statistics. All the values of the arguments presented show T -Values above 1.96 and P -values below 0.05 (significance level = 5%).   Thus, these results guarantee the significance of relationships and allow differences between genders to be tested.   According to the analysis, the Use construct presented a r² determination coefficient of 0.541, considered high, and the Imitation construct presented an r² of 0.376, considered high as well. In addition to evaluating the magnitude of r² values as a predictive precision criterion, the Q ² value, which is an indicator of predictive relevance of the model, was evaluated. The Q² measure applies an example reuse technique that omits part of the data matrix and uses model estimates to predict the omitted part. Specifically, when a PLS-SEM mode l has predictive relevance, it accurately predicts indicator data points in reflective measurement models. Table 3 shows the values of r2, adjusted r2 and Q2.    Table 3: Results of R2, adjusted R2, and Q2 values   Construct  R2 Q2 Imitation  0.376  0.102  Use 0.541  0.207   For SEM models, Q² values greater than zero for a specific reflective endogenous latent variable indicate the predictive relevance of the path model. In the case of this study, the value is greater than zero.   To test the hypotheses of the study in relation to differences between relationships and gender differences, a multigroup analysis was performed.Table 4 presents the results of the analysis of the significant relationships of the constructs between groups of male and female respondents .  Table 4: Relationship differentiation analysis – Genders     Coefficientdifference- Gender  p-Value Attitude -> Use 0,341  0,016  BC -> Use  0,103  0,229  IM -> Use  0,206  0,914  UNC -> IM  0,122  0,167  Note: BC = Behavior Control; IM = Imitation; UNC = Uncertainty   From the results of Table 4, it is observed that there are significant differences only in the relationship between Attitude and Use in terms of gender. The effect is positive in males (0.330) and negative in females ( -0.011).   Improved Model and Synthesis of Hypotheses Tests  The adjusted model resulting from the research is presented in Figure 2.

Table 5: Hypotheses confirmation   Hypotheses  Description  Results  H1 There are differences between the relationships of the antecedents of behavior of using social networks to protest among users of different genders.  Confirmed  H1a There are gender differences in the relationship between attitude towards behavior and the use of social networks to participate in protests  Confirmed  H1b  There are gender differences in the relationship between perceived behavioral control and the use of social networks to participate in protests.  Not Confirmed  H1c There are gender differences in the relationship between imitation and the use of social networks to participate in protests.  Not Confirmed  H1d  There are gender differences in the relationship between uncertainty and imitation.  Not Confirmed  Regarding the attitude construct, the results show that the attitude effect on participation in protests by social networks influences positively in men and negatively in women. In other words, men believe that using the hashtag can contribute to improve awareness of events and strengthen protest movements, women do not believe.   The high explanatory value of the imitation  construct demonstrates that people used social media to imitate other people, be they known, personality or artists. The values obtained in the construct uncertainty  enhance this result and show the behavior of the herd in this case, demonstrating that people imitated others, even though they were not sure of the whole context about the movements. In the case of this relationship, there are no differences in behavior between men and women.   Another factor of high impact in the use of the application was Behavioral Control. This result indicates that the fact that using the application is easy for the respondent audience,makes it more used. In this relationship,  there are also no differences between genders.   DISCUSSION  The selection of both constructs use of social networks for participation in movement and imitation are reasonably explained by the values of the coefficient of determination equal to 54.10% and 3 7.60%, respectively. Farther, the study demonstrates that participation in online movements through social networks is explained by the constructs attitude, behavioral control, and imitation preceded by uncertainty.   The results of the presented model go b eyond the studies on which they were based, including the gender multigroup analysis and presenting a new model of technological adoption with new elements, such as the herd behavior, embracing the imitation, and the uncertainty constructs. There is also a  contribution to a greater understanding of the influence of social media on collective activism or movements (Gil de Zúñiga et al., 2012; Lance Bennett & Segerberg, 2011) .  In order to identify gender differences in social network protests‘ participation, the results feature relevant effect, between gender, of the 
	29  attitude on participation in protests by social networks influences.The positive effect verified for the male gender could in dicate that, in his understanding, participating in online protests through social media can improve awareness of the events, giving strength to the movement and helping to reduce the tension of the protests. For women, the effect is almost null, with nega tive values, which leads to the conclusion that females do not participate in movements thinking about participation as helping raise awareness or strengthen the movement.This attitude towards the female gender can be explained through studies on female po litical engagement, where there is evidence that women engaging in less visible political behaviors on social media because they are more likely to use social media for relationship maintenance and seem to be able to overcome political's confrontations and  exposure (Bode, 2017) .  Although the results show the influence of the attitude‘s effect in protests by social networks has been positive in relation to men and negative in relation to women, this subject is still in an incipient stage of study andthere is still unexamined proofs.Such evidence is presented as the phenomenon of the hashtag #EleNão (#NotHim), created mostly by Brazilian female  citizens and shared worldwide, what evidence an opportunity of engrossing in this theme.   Meanwhile, the difference between genders for the other relationshipswas not confirmed through this analysis, being the tendency to imitate through social networks when there is no deep knowledge about the subject explained by HB is the same between males and females, as well as the perceived behavioral control at the use of social networks to participate in protests.   Among the limitations of the study, can be highlighted the representativeness of the sample,which included only Brazilians who participated  in social networks, and the cross -section nature of data, that also hinders the analysis to understand how the association between variables of interest evolve over times.   As suggestions for future research, it is recommended to review the questionnaire and adapt it to a wider range of real situations that represent the constructs, test the model presented in new technologies, and with a larger sample, test other moderators and conduct longitudinal studies with qualitative methodologies.

Since the escalation of web 2.0 and the internet within the last decade and the booming interest in big data and expansion of industry 4.0, VC is dee med as an ideal proxy for practitioners to share and earned instant knowledge that can beimplemented within business activities and day to day application. Despite this emerging interest, there has been no comprehensive study on the overall antecedents of KS in VC. Applying a systematic review, a total of 68 relevant articles that discusses knowledge sharing (KS) via VC are evaluated. Several central themes of theories applied in this field within the literature are discussed on its importance and relevance . Important antecedents arealso reviewed on its practicality and implementation in understanding the role of KS in VC. The implication of this review would benefit stakeholders in maintaining the sustainability of VC as the platform for a knowledge -based s ociety.   Keywords : Theories, Antecedents, Knowledge Management, Knowledge Sharing, Virtual Community .  INTRODUCTION  Knowledge is vital in ensuring that organizationsand industries to sustain in the current challenging business world. As the world shifted towards the advancement of internet and digitalization, virtual platform has served as a vibrant tool in knowledge distribution. Virtual communities (VC) provide a platform for users to communicate and interact without having to meet face to face (Chang et al., 2015). Practically, employees have been found to seek knowledge by consulting their peers through various virtu al networks and social media rather than accessing knowledge database and repository (Akhavan et al. 2015; Djelantik, 2019). Hence, the proposition and availability of VC have provided employees the chance to interact and look out for peers that can give instant knowledge by the community through the web.   Many of the previous studies have focused on the aspect of individual, organizational, and technological factors (Al -Kurdi et al., 2018). The three elements are embedded within the underpinning theories applied in KS studies throughout the literature. With the extensive studies on VC as the emerging area of knowledge management, there have been various theories implemented in understanding the KS behavior among members in this community (Fauzi et al., 2018). Among the commonly used theories are related to social -related theories such as social capital, social cognitive, social exchange, and social identity. Other theories that are known to the knowledge management communities 
	 33  are the theory of planned beha viour and theory of reasoned action. In understanding the underlying foundation of member‘s engagement on KS within VC, relevant and related theories should be recognized and correlated among each other‘sin developing a holistic model consisting of relevan t antecedents of KS in VC.   With this in mind, this paper tends to review all related studies from the year 2006 -2019, thirteen years on KS within the VC. The main objective of this review is to provide insight and an in -depth understanding of the theorie s and essential antecedents that have been applied in the literature associated with the user's KS behaviour in VC. In parallel with today's digital development, knowledge should be shared freely and safely to ensure that implicit and explicit knowledge co uld be captured for the benefits of members in VC. Hence, a knowledge -based society can be enhanced and maintained for the betterment of society.   Knowledge sharing in virtual community  KS is a process where knowledge, expertise, experience, skills, and information that is exchanged between families, friends, communities, and organizations (Charband and Navimipour 2016). Virtual or online knowledge communities consist of people having the same interest, profession, or goals. They share and interchange kno wledge for their use in daily life by engaging in social interaction (Feng and Ye, 2016). People use VC not only for knowledge exchange but also a tool for retrieving information, social support, entertainment, and also recreation (Phang et al., 2009; Fauz i, 2019).   Despite that VC is widely research and applied, the term and notion of VC application differ from one industry and context to another (Bolisani and Scarso, 2014).Several scholars have termed it as community of practice (Zboralski et al, 2009, Je on et al, 2011a; Hau et al 2013; Chu et al., 2014; Tseng & Kuo, 2014; Nistor et al., 2015), virtual community of practice (Usoro et al, 2007; Fang & Chu, 2010; Majewski et al., 2011, Chang et al., 2016), professional virtual community (Lin et al., 2009; Ch en & Hung, 2010; Chiu et al., 2011; Tamjidyamcholo et al., 2014), online communities (Ma & Agarwal, 2007; Phang et l., 2009; Chai & Kim, 2010, Erden et al, 2012; Lai & Chen, 2014), online knowledge communities (Ye et al., 2015; Feng & Ye, 2016), online que stion and answer community (Jin et al., 2013; Khansa et al 2015; Guan et al., 2018), online health community (Yan et al., 2016; Zheng et al., 2017), virtual innovation community (Zhang et al., 2017a; Pirkkalainen et al., 2018), online user community (Hau  & Kang, 2016), online discussion communities (Kumi & Sabherwal, 2018), online travel community (Ku, 2012; Yuan et al., 2016), peer to peer problem solving (P3) virtual community (Zhao et al 2013) and virtual learning community (Chen et al., 2009; Lu et al., 2013). As there are many terminologies used within this area, VC will be used throughout this paper as the majority of studies had used this term as it is more general and involveda broad definition describing the aspect of a virtual platform.    The the oretical framework of this review is based on the frequently adapted theories used in VC. These include the theory of planned behavior/reasoned action, technology acceptance model, social capital theory, social cognitive theory, social identity theory, soc ial exchange theory, expectancy disconfirmation theory, motivation theory, and use & gratification theory. All the studies included apply at least one theory or integration of two or more, that could facilitate in understanding KS behavior in VC.    METHOD OLOGY  This section delineates the method in assessing this systematic review of KS within the scope of VC. The review includes all articles within the indexed journal of Scopus and Web of science. The eight databases that were included in the review includ e Science Direct, Emerald Insight, Taylor & Francis, Wiley Blackwell, Springer -Link, IEEE Explore, Wiley & Blackwell, Inderscience, and JSTOR
	. These databases are selected because they are reliable database and has an extensive record of peer -reviewed arti cles within the scope of VC. The process in retrieving articles related to Knowledge sharing in VC. The author used the PRISMA method (Moher et al., 2015). This method enables the ease of the systematic review by having exclusion criteria, review process s teps, data analysis, and abstraction.PRISMA serves as a checklist to clearly explain the need for a specific topic (Wormald & Evans, 2018). It adds to the future

Searching process for related and identical terminologies. These terms and synonym were searched through dictionaries, thesaurus and encyclopaedia. The search string used in this study includes the keyw ord (―knowledge sharing‖ OR ―knowledge exchange‖ OR ―knowledge transfer‖ OR ―knowledge distribution‖ OR ―knowledge acquisition‖) AND (―virtual community‖ OR ―online community‖ OR ―community of practice‖ OR ―professional virtual community‖ OR ―virtual team‖ ). The initial result had found a total of 1,502 articles having keywords, as stated. After screening using PRISMA methodology, the final relevant studies accepted for review were 68.

Based on article type, only articles with empirical data are taken. Review article, book chapter, conference proceeding is not included. Secondly, only articles in English are accepted, to avoid problems in translating and having originally written articles in English. Thirdly, all the studies are  from the period of 13 years, from 2006 to 2019. This is considered to be adequate time in viewing research evolution in the VC field of study. Lastly, studies that are chosen within the context of VC or related terminology are accepted. Studies from other  disciplines and contexts are excluded. Table 2 summarizes the criteria for this review.   Table 2: Inclusion and exclusion criteria  Inclusion criteria  Exclusion criteria  Available as a full -text article  No full text available  Written in English  Other than English  Within the domain of virtual community and other related terminology  Qualitative study  From the year 2006 to 2019    Eligibility  A total of 69 articles made up to this stage. This stage requires the authors to screen related article based on  the title and abstract. It is a second stage screening to ensure that the articles included are based on KS in VC studies. A total of 68 articles were included for analysis.Figure 1 summarizes the four -stage process of the PRISMA method, indicating identi fication, screening, eligibility, and finally, included articles.   RESULT  Overview of studies  All the articles were searched in 8 databases, resulting in 68 studies. The summary of the reviews is shown in table 2. Most of the studies were found in computer  cyberpsychology journals, with other areas including management and social psychology. The majority were conducted in the Asia Pacific region that includes Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong, and China. Other prominent countries have the USA, Singapore, Malay sia, Australia, and several European countries. Respondents of the studies vary from professional, students, teachers, teenagers, and the common public using VC as education and entertainment purpose. Most of the studies applied related social theories by integrating 2 or 3 theories with the minority using only one theory or underpinning framework. Table 3 summarizes the 68 articles found from this review.

As the VC platform involve social interaction among members, the majority of researchers applied theories related to social factors that can ultimately understand the antecedents of member's behavio r. In this section, a list of mostly used theories are discussed:   Theory of planned behavior and reasoned action  This theory is probably the most used in understanding KS behavior. It was first developed by Ajzen and Fishbein (1975) as theory of reasoned action. An individual intention towards a behavior is determined by the attitude and subjective norm. In 1991, Ajzen had extended the theory of reasoned action into the theory of planned behavior by introducing perceived behavioral control as the third ind ependent variable. Perceived behavioral control explains the ability of a person to perform the behavior in question. The use of TPB in VC studies enables scholars to understand the behavior of members to share depend on the personal attitude, perception o f other people towards the behavior (subjective norm), and the perceived ability of the person to perform it. Studies that applied the theory of reasoned action were done by Shu and Chuang (2011) and Lin and Huang (2013), while Gang and Ravichandran (2015)  integrated the theory with social exchange theory. Various studies had used TPB in VC KS studies. This includes Erden et al. (2012) and Chen et al. (2012). Some studies integrated this theory with other relevant theories by incorporating social -related fa ctors and extending the TPB model (Jeon et al. 2011b; Cho et al. 2010; Tsai& Bagozzi 2014; Chang et al. 2015).   Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)  TAM is a model that explains individual behavior that is dependent on an individual's attitude in executing that specific behavior. It evaluates each of that outcome as a function of one's belief on the expectation in performing such behavior (Ku, 2012). the model constitutes the concept of usefulness and perceived ease of use (Davis, 1989). Perceived usefulness  is a person's perception that using technology can bring benefits and enhance their application performance. Perceived ease of use is the ability to use such technology without having any difficulty (Papadopoulos et al., 2013). The review found thatfour 
	 42  relevant studies applied the technology acceptance model (Hung & Cheng, 2013; Ku, 2012; Papadopoulos et al., 2013; Yuan et al., 2016).   Social Capital Theory  The social capital theory explains the network of relationships that are created among individuals or a group of people with the set of resources within it. This system would have enhanced and positively impact interpersonal KS among the members (Chiu et al. 2006). Nahapiet and Ghoshal (1998) described social capital theory in three perspectives, based on KS in communities. The structural capital (nodes that are interconnected, creating a pattern), relational capital (leveraging and creating assets through connection), and cognitive capital (systems of meaning among members that produce resources by havi ng shared representation and interpretations). Among the factors identified in social capital are trust, recognition, common language, and shared vision. Among studies that practiced only social capital theory was Yao et al. (2015). In practice, social cap ital theory usually combined with other theories in assessing members of virtual communities KS behaviour. Many studies integrated social capital with either social cognitive theory, social identity, social exchange and other related theories (Chiu et al. 2006; Shan et al. 2013; Zeng et al. 2014; Tseng & Kuo, 2014; Hau & Kang 2016; Cheng & Guo, 2015, Yen, 2016; Chang et al., 2016; Al -Sharo et al., 2017; Guan et al. 2018). A theory related to social capital is the theory of collective action. The theory expl ained how problems should be avoided, arising from the existence of conflicting incentives. It suggests individuals engage with action in context due to social capital (Coleman, 1990). The study that applied this theory was Chang et al., (2016).   Social Co gnitive Theory  The social cognitive theory comprises three factors, personal, environment, and behavior that play essential roles in influencing individual interactivity (Hsu et al. 2007). The social cognitive theory explained that individual personal fact ors interact with the behavior and environmental aspect, which ends up with triadic reciprocity (Lu et al. 2013). Among the determinants in personal factors are self -efficacy and outcome expectations, as both can predict a person's behavior (Bandura, 1997) . While trust and altruism are considered as an environmental factor as it can influence personal characteristics and the behavior itself (Papadopoulos et al., 2013). Others had considered the norm of reciprocity as factors in the environment while perceiv ed relative advantage and perceived compatibility as personal factors (Lin et al., 2009; Chen and Hung 2010), There is one study that tested on several individual factors such as hope, optimism, and tenacity (Zhang et al. 2017a). The social cognitive theor y had been applied solely in many studies (Hsu et al., 2007; Lin et al., 2009; Chen & Hung, 2010; Xu et al., 2012; Lu et al., 2013). There are also many studies had combined and integrated with other theories (Chiu et al. 2006; Cho et al., 2010; Shan et al ., 2013; Papadopoulos et al. 2013; Zeng et al., 2014; Tseng & Kuo, 2014; Chang et al., 2015; Hau & Kang, 2016; Zhang et al., 2017b; Guan et al., 2018 Hao et al., 2019).   Social Identity Theory  Based on social identity theory, the characteristic of a person  determines their sharing behavior rather than the distinctive feature, according to their social identification (Turner, 1982). This theory is rooted in personal belongings to a group. It is an individual -based perception that defined the team within a gr oup membership. Social identity differentiates a person and other members of a group from other group members (Kim et al. 2011). Social identity consists of three main domains of the interactive process of psychology: cognitive, evaluative, and affective ( Kumi & Sabherwal, 2018). Personal identification within social groups enables members to develop self -esteem and positively influence attitudes and behaviors
	. The affective domain plays a role in the group's emotional attachment. Evaluative, on the other h and, is vital to personal self -esteem as an outcome of association with groups. Cognitive in self -identity is the creation of awareness belonging to a group and having an objective in pursuing goals. These three main attributes of social identity explain h ow individual develop identities and hence leads to attitude and behaviors (Tajfel, 1978).Studies that applied social identity theory include Kim et al. (2011), Ku (2012), and Zhao et al. (2012). Studies that integrated identity theory with other theory in clude social presence (Shen et al., 2010) social 
	 43  cognitive and social exchange and social capital (Zeng et al. 2014; Cheng & Guo; Guan et al. 2018) and extended theory of planned behavior (Tsai & Bagozzi, 2014).   Social Exchange Theory  The social exchange was developed in explaining a non -contractual relationship between individuals (Staples & Webster, 2008). Social exchange in VC studies posits that the engagement between individuals in online communities enables them to receive some form of benefit (Phang  et al. 2009). VC serves as a platform for users to contribute and receive different information and resources from various sources. These resources are a form of social exchange, either tangible or intangible. During the exchange, it may constitute cost o r benefits. The use of social exchange theory may facilitate scholars to assess which dimension or factors that are highly perceived by individual either in knowledge contribution or act of seeking. Social exchange theory explains that the factors that lea d the individual towards social interaction are based on the expectation that he or she would receive social rewards, such as respect, status, and approval (Liao et al. 2013). The level of interaction is based on cost and benefits consideration. If the ben efits are more than the cost, the chance for them to engage in such interaction is high. Among the crucial factors in social exchange theory is trust. For the social exchange to be realized, reciprocation among the exchange members should be rooted in trus t (Blau, 1964). This is to ensure a complete exchange to note the perceived obligation and strengthen trustworthiness among members in VC.   Literature shows that plenty of studies had applied this theory (Staples & Webster, 2008; Liao et al. 2013; Yan et a l., 2016; Park & Gabbard, 2018). Some other studies had combined with different theories, such as the theory of reasoned action (Gang & Ravichandran, 2015), the theory of social capital, identity and cognitive (Guan et al., 2018; Xiong et al. 2018) and val ue theory (Phang et al., 2009). An extension of the social exchange theory is value theory. It explained that an individual is attached to different values based on objects or concepts that can fulfill their requirement (Harper, 1974). Studies that applied  value theory were Phang et al. (2009) and Lai & Chen (2014). Another theory that is similar to the social exchange theory is rational action theory. According to rational action theory, if a person perceived that there is benefit from a particular behavio r, it will be more likely for them to engage with the said behavior (Hau et al. 2013). In line with this theory, expected benefits such as organizational reward, reciprocity, and enjoyment would encapsulate one to share in an online platform.   Meanwhile, equity theory corresponds to the perception and request of fairness/equity of individuals concerning a relationship (Cohen & Greenberg, 1982). According to Feng and Ye (2016), equity theory is the assessment of an individual in social exchange. It includes  the ratio of the input and output from a relationship. It also has other person ration of the production from their input. Equity theory suggests that a healthy relationship between individual existed when each of them perceived that their output is equal  to what they have provided in the input, suggesting fair as key to KS.Organizational support theory is also an extension of the social exchange theory. The theory proposes that there two categories of perception (organizational support and supervisor supp ort) that constitute one behavior within an organization (Eisenberger et al., 2002). It also refers to the general belief behold by an individual concerning how the organization values their contribution and welfare is being taken care of (Eisenberger et a l., 1986).   Expectancy Disconfirmation Theory (EDT)  Another theory in VC KS behavior is expectancy disconfirmation theory (EDT) that was proposed by Oliver (1980)
	. It explained that person repurchase intentions are depending on their satisfaction. This the ory explains an individual continuance to share knowledge based on their satisfaction as the main factor (Jin et al., 2013). It is also known as expectancy confirmation theory. Satisfaction, on the other hand, is depending on one pre -purchase expectation a nd post -purchase disconfirmation of expectations. In 1993, EDT was revived by including affection, performance, and equity as the antecedents of customer satisfaction and repurchase intention. This theory work by the customers resulting in expectations pos itively confirmed (perceived performance more than expectation), confirmed (perceived 
	 44  performance same as expectation), and negatively confirmed (perceived performance less than expectation). Customer's or user's expectation is the basis of evaluating satisfaction. In an event where confirmation occurs, the satisfaction will fall either lower or more than the expectation. A common theme found in this theory, regardless of its application, is the disconfirmation size and direction. Consumers would be satisfi ed in the case of positive disconfirmation and dissatisfied when negative disconfirmation occurs (Venkatesh & Goyal, 2010). In the VC context, members would have a certain expectation in using the platform to search for knowledge. Their future participatio n will depend on their satisfaction on whether their participation would enable them to receive relevant knowledge based on their needs. Studies in VC that had applied this theory were Chiu et al. (2011) and Jin et al. (2013). Chiu et al. (2011) had integr ated with justice theory and social network factors.    Motivation Theory  Three theories are based on motivation: motivation theory, self -determination theory, and expectancy theory of motivation. Motivation theory was developed to understand human behavio rderived from the expectation of beneficial outcomes (Zhang et al., 2017a). The two main motivation is intrinsic and extrinsic. Self -determination theory (SDT) is a theory explaining human motivation that is concerned with tendencies of one's inherent grow th and the needs of their psychology. These two main domains have a direct effect on their self -motivation (Yoon and Rolland, 2012). On the other hand, the expectancy theory of motivation is based on the perceived consequences factor that relies on the act ion and value of each consequence (Vroom, 1964). The perceived consequence is known as the chances of a specific consequence that would like to happen as a result of a behavior.   Use and Gratification Theory (U&G theory)  U&G theory originated from the fiel d of communication, where scholars apply it to determine why members engage in the community as a tool in fulfilling their needs (Chen et al. 2013; Mairaru et al. 2019). Katz et al. (1974) posited that the U&G theory was introduced to understand the user's  application of media. How the users take the initiative, rather than being a free rider in receiving the message and manipulating medium in searching for an information meeting their needs. As the fast increment of internet usage since the last two decade s and a rapid level of interactivity compared to conventional media has paved the way for U&G theory to assess internet use motivations. The theory has been adapted in user acceptance of instant messaging, the internet, emails, electronic bulletin boards, and VC (Yen, 2016). With the development of the internet, the user's acceptance of the theory has been empowered due to easy conversion from one medium to another (Xu et al., 2012).   U&G is based on three dimensions: process, socialization, and content (Peters et al. 2007). These three dimensions can be further illustrated as entertainment (process), social needs (socialization), and information (content). The user's motivation to participate in acquiring knowledge in VC is different. Knowledge required in professional forums is perceived to be more critical than social -based VC, thus focusing on the content dimension. While members in social -based, their weigh is more on the social needs and entertainment aspect. In studying VC KS behavior, these three d imensions would vary depends on the platform basis and the community involved. Studies applying U&G theory were Chiu et al., (2013) and Yen (2016).   Other theories  Other relevant theories used in this study are the Triandis model (Jeon et al., 2011a; Tamji dyamcholo et al., 2014). This theory explains an individual towards behavior in question. The behavior is influenced by facilitating factors that can positively impact, such as perceived consequences, social factors, and affect
	. Another critical theory is the sense of community theory. It was first formulated by McMillan and Chavis (1986), which was further enhanced by McMillan (1996). The purpose of community theory is described as the belonging feelings and feeling that the group members are matter to one  another, having a shared faith among members. Each member needs to commit to meet the member's need. While an advanced definition of this theory is described as a "feeling of belonging spirit, having trust feeling on the structure of authority. Awareness and mutual benefit that come from being together with the 
	 45  spirit that exhibits from shared experience, preserved as art" (McMillan, 1996, p. 315). The study that applied a sense of community theory was Nistor et al., (2015). Other theories applied were sel f-perception theory (Yan et al., 2013), goal setting theory (Khansa et al., 2015), lead user theory (Hau and Kang, 2016), social influence theory (Liao, 2017), attribution and self-presentation theory (Ma & Agarwal, 2007)   DISCUSSION  Understanding the theo ries used in VC members, KS is vital. A majority of studies focused on the aspect of social within all the theories presented; understandably, social factorsare deemed to be of the utmost importance. Even the theory of planned behavior and reasoned action is based on human relationships with one another on the aspect of the subjective norm (Erden et al., 2012). Almost all the major studies have used social -related theories directly in their studies (social exchange, social identity, social cognitive, and so cial capital). Even though other studies did not apply a direct social theory, mostly other theories have embedded a social foundation underlying construct or having social -relational constructs such as trust, reputation, norm of reciprocity, and enjoyment  in helping others. These factors are so important in VC studies as interaction with other people may lead to trustworthiness that builds up from such a relationship.   Trust is the most studies factor in KS literature (Bandura, 1997). The importance of tr ust in understanding VCmembers KS is deemed crucial as sharing on the internet comes with the possibility of risk and liability. Trust, together with commitment, is considered to be supported by the feeling of belongingness (Chang et al. 2016, Capello and Fagian, 2005). The concept of trust is well documented within three theories, namely social capital, social identity, and social exchange. Documented from this review, the majority of studies applied the construct of trust either directly from the three th eories or by having the trust construct as an indirect factor. Multiple studies applied theories that are based on trust by nature such as applying trust in multiple dimension (Chai & Kim, 2010), trust -building factors (Hsu et al., 2011), Social factors wh ich include trust (Majewski et al., 2011) and trust -commitment theory (Chang et al., 2015).  The three most cited categories within the trust domain are ability, integrity, and benevolence (Zeng et al., 2014). Meanwhile, Usoro et al.(2007)termed the ability  to trust as competence -based trust. Integrity is regarded as the expectation of an individual that everyone within VC is following a prescribed general set of rules, principles, and values (Chiu et al., 2006). Benevolence is a preference to commit to a ki nd and charitable act. Meanwhile, competence or ability is known as the activity based on one qualification, skills, and training (Usoro et al., 2007). These three domains are distinct among each other, but the result shows that they are empirically insepa rable. For a proper KS to be realized, all three dimensions of trust should be inculcated.  Apart from the trust domain, there have been researchers that studied trust within a different aspect. Such as work by Hsu et al. (2011) that studied trust in member s and trust in the system. This is the only study that focuses on the trust in the system. It is deemed vital in such a way when every member of VC can be trustworthiness, but the system might jeopardize a member's personal information. If the system is co mpromised, data can be leaked to the wrong hand, to the extent used for criminal activities. The two different categories of trust have made an understanding of trust in different aspects of KS via VC.  On the other hand, Hau et al. (2013) have adopted a t rusted domain in measuring the different types of behavior of sharing based on tacit and explicit knowledge
	. It was identified that trust and risk profiles of users are different based on the type of knowledge they share (tacit and explicit) (Becerra et al ., 2008).   Social exchange theory has a very significant impact on the study of VC members KS. This theory is based on the perceived benefits and the return of sharing behaviors of members in VC. The human being would want something in return when they co ntribute and participate. As this basis, the theory has led to other related or derivation from a social exchange such as respect, approval, and status (Liao et al., 2013). This social reward would be the main reason whether members are willing to share th eir knowledge freely. The theory perceived that human would weigh the cost and benefits before engaging in any social interaction. Phang et al. (2009) and Lai & Chen (2014) applied value theory that suggests members value realizing from VC that 
	 46  confides on  participation in knowledge seeking and contribution. According to Harper (1974), a different type of profession and group value knowledge differently which lead to their specific behavior. Professionals may value VC as a source of knowledge within their s pecific filed while it is different from a socially -oriented VC. A VC that focuses on social may regard it as a platform for entertainment.  Meanwhile, in equity theory (a similar theory to social exchange) suggest that fairness or equity should adhere whe n individual engage in any relationship. The theory suggests that when one provides certain input in a relationship, he or she should attain the same amount of output. Other theories having a similar concept to social exchange are rational action theory an d organizational support theory. It can be understood from the literature that having much exchange within the community is vital in ensuring that knowledge can be circulated within the VC network. Factors related to self -attainment must be attached within  the scope of KS. This attainment is considered not only in virtual setting but in a physical KS environment.   FUTURE WORK  Future avenues should see in the context of personalities that are significant towards VC member's KS. From the 68 studies, no studie s hadapplied the big five personalities that are commonly used by scholars in organizational studies. Despite that were few studies undertaken on a broader aspect personality (Chu et al., 2014) and preferably on some specific personality of the big five su ch as conscientiousness (Fang & Chiu, 2010; Hao et al., 2019) and openness to experience (Yu et al., 2010). From these extensive and latest studies on KS behavior on VC, it can be seen that personality traits were somewhat neglected and received little att ention. By understanding which traits are having the most impact on KS behavior, scholars and practitioners can make use of the VC platform to be the best possible mean in ensuring that knowledge can be disseminated. For example, it may be postulated that those who are high in extroversion and conscientiousness would have no problem communicating and sharing knowledge due to their inclination towards open interaction and enjoy helping others. On the other hand, a person high in neuroticism might be more cau tious, and having a calculative measure to share and received information either from peers or strangers. All the social -related factors can be related to individual personality traits that can provide meaningful insight into organizational behavior studie s such as in VC.  With extensive studies on VC, there have been many terms used in describing individual online knowledge participation. Another term used by Hsseinoiun et al. (2018) is big data community, focusingon how scholars are actively participating  in information and knowledge retrieval from big data. The domain focused on knowledge quality, system quality, use, user satisfaction, and community success. With the enhanced development of industrial revolution 4.0, the need to engage within big data an alytics would see as a significant leap towards advanced technological adoption. As younger members participate in VC, the perceived ability to apply advanced tools in VC is deemed appropriate. Those who are not able to commit to using recent technology wo uld be left behind and thus unable to make benefits from it. Future work should look into using the theory of acceptance model with the application of industrial revolution software and tools. Furthermore, the use of big data and data analytics should pave  the way for VC moderators and stakeholders in acquiring useful information that can further improve the function of VC in the near future.   CONCLUSION  VC has provided the best possible environment for the communities to engage in KS activities. As the wor ld develops even further, people would prefer to attain information and knowledge within a short period
	. The availability of VC realizes this rapid information retrieval. More and more professional individuals from various professions and socially oriented communities have used VC to acquire or share their knowledge.  This paper has managed to review 68 studies within the 13 -year period (2006 -2019) that has conducted KS studies within the scope of VC. Most of the studies were focusing on the related social t heories that involved much domain of social variables such as trust, reputation, norm of reciprocity, enjoyment in helping, and many others. All these antecedents are within the scope of main theories available within VC literature encompassing the theory of planned behavior, 
	 47  technology acceptance model, social capital theory, social identity theory, social exchange theory, expectancy disconfirmation theory, and use & gratification theory. Other related theories and antecedents had also been briefly discuss ed throughout this review process.   REFERENCES  Ajzen, I. and Fishbein, M.

Keywords : Integrated Marketing Communication, S ocial Media, Digital Media, Modern Integrated Marketing Communication .  INTRODUCTION  Though the first 'P' of marketing is product but marketing starts with communicating product s or services related information to target prospects. This creates awareness about products or services to the customers and helps in convincing them to buy the offered products  (Naeem & Naz, 2013) . As a marketer, we try every c ommunication channel that helps to make effective reach of information to target audience. Message reach has become a key aspect of successful marketing and helps to achieve objectives of the company and brand equity (Cvetkov, 2019). Today, organizations a re using various forms of media to reach target customers  (Brunello, 2013) . This has given birth to Integrated Marketing Communication (IMC). Integrated marketing communication is defined as a strategic process to choose, develo p, execute, evaluate, and coordinate with all the stakeholders of organization for a given period of time (Belch. & Belch, 2007) . Effective use of integrated marketing communication has recognized a valuation instrument to achie ve marketing objectives. Marketers can use it strategically in order to gain competitive advantage, and increase sales volume, market shares, and brand equity  (Mongkol, 2014; Bao, et al.,  (2019)) .  Integrating marketing communic ation tools is regarded as prime concern these  days because of efficiency of these communication tools 
	 53  (Shafi & Madhavaiah, 2013; Valos et al., 2017; Mortimer & Laurie, 2017). However, there are many reasons of growing integrated marketing communication pr actices in today‘s business  (Brunello, 2013) such as targeting mass consumers, event marketing, social networking sites & direct emails, accountability of media, payment methods, etc. In this globalization era, it is not possible to research all target con sumers because of diversified characteristics of customers and availability of diverse range of communication tools. Development in technology and communication media is remodelling integrated marketing communication (Keller, 2016; Zwerin, Clarke & Clarke III, 2020). Many companies are increasing their budget for adverti sing their offerings on programmatic advertising and social media to gain competitive advantage (Valos, et al., 2017). So far, traditional IMC consists of few popular tools such as advertis ing, sales promotion, direct marketing, and public relations (Jones & Schee, 2008), which are not enough to research generation -Z (Bhatt, Goyal and Yadav, 2018; Adeola, Hinson & Evans, 2020).   Therefore, digital media marketing, and social media have to be  integrated into the traditional IMC tools to make it modern IMC. Digital marketing is defined as an exploration of digital technologies which is a channel to research potential customers and communicates required information to achieve organisational obje ctives and brand awareness  (Sawicki, 2016; Lee & Cho, 2020) . Social media is collection of applications build on technological foundation of Web 2.0 and helps to create community and exchange users‘ generated contents (Kaplan & Haenlein, 2010). Digital and social media helps to engage target audience, personalization of message, user generated contents, ubiquitous connectivity, social graph, and is environment  friendly (Sawicki, 2016; Mairaru, et al., 2019). Digital media grew by  33% and social media grew by 47% whereas television advertising shrank by 1.3% in 2019. Digital and social media has likely  become 2nd largest media with market share of 26.9% in 2020  (Sawatzky, 2019) .   The major role of IMC is  to convey consistent messages and build long term healthy relationship with customers. This process helps to increase brand equity of the company  (Shafi & Madhavaiah, 2013) . Brand equity is considered as an asset  for the comp any and is incorporated in balance sheet of the company. The effective marketing activities improve the valuation of brand equity. Because of huge advertising cost, immense competition, and flattening demand, companies tr y to improve the efficiency of mark eting overheads. The power of brand depends on the minds of consumers. The minds of customers depends on how they have experienced and perceived brand offering over the period of time. Aaker (1991) has suggest ed five dimensions of brand equity and which  add value to it are awareness, perceived quality, associations, loyalty, and other proprietary brand assets. These dimensions can be improved through modern IMC approach.   The impact of traditional  IMC on brand equity has been studied by several scholar s however , there are few literatures where social media has been integrated into traditional IMC. There is a  study gap in this area where both digital media and social media are integrated into traditional IMC to create brand equity. This signifies that there  is a need to study modern IMC to improve brand equity. This study is going to integrate both digital media and social media into traditional integrated marketing communication and upgrading it into modern integrated marketing communication to achieve mark eting objective s and increase brand equity. This study is targeted to tourism and hospitality industry of India. This study has considered IMC tools such as advertising, sales promotion, direct marketing, public relations (Brunello, 2013; Jones & Schee, 20 08), social media (Braojos, Benitez & Liorens, 2015; Valos, et al
	., 2017) , and digital media marketing. This  study will also find the effectiveness of Modern IMC over Traditional IMC to create brand equity in tourism and hospitality industry.   REVIEWS OF LITERATURE  Brand Equity  Promotion and positioning of any product in the market need s several types of marketing communication channels. These marketing communication elements make clear understanding of the message and enforce brand image in the mind of co nsumers (Shakeel Ul Rehma n & M Syed Ibrahim, 2014) , although marketing communication channels need to be modif ied according to customers‘ 
	 54  demographic factors. In the field of marketing, major promotional activities are taking place under IMC and result in brand awareness, brand  loyalty and brand equity among customers (Selvakumar, 2014) . Branding and brand equity are  the most valuable intangible assets of the organizations. Outcome results of marketing activities are the end results of brand equity which place  and maintain an identified value preposition in the mind of customer (Hartley & Pickton, 2010) . One of the key benefit and a rationale behind building a strong brand of a product or an organization is to increase effectiveness of marketing communication and positioning in the min d of customer (Keller, 2017) .   Traditional Integrated Marketing Communication (IMC)  Integrated marketing communication is one of the major element of promotional market ing strategy. Prior to digitalization, integrated marketing communication consists of advertising, sales promotion, word of mouth, direct marketing, and public relations (Philip J. Kitchen & Don E. Schultz b, 2009) . These major elements were benefiting businesses in terms of creating product‘s awareness and yielding more revenue (Selvakumar, 2014) . IMC is basically a multi -facet communication technique which synchronizes the different promotional elements of marketing mix to create and provide greater  value to target customer and promotional impact towards customers in the market (Rodney G. Duffet & Myles Wakeham, 2016) .   American Association of Advertising Agencies (AAAA) formally defined Integrated Marketing Communications (IMC) as:   ―a concept of marketing communications, planning that recognizes the added value of a comprehensive plan  that evaluates the strategic roles of a variety of communications disciplines – for example, general advertising, direct response, sales promotion, and public relations – and combines these disciplines to provide clarity, consistency, and maximum communic ation impact‖  Amanda Zwerin, Theresa B. Clarke & Irvine Clarke III (2019).   H1: Traditional Integrated Marketing  Communication has positive impact on building brand equity.   Advertising  Unlike personal selling, advertising covers target market and mass pot ential customer base. It is basically a non -personal form of creating awareness (Victor A. Barger & Lauren I. Labrecque, 2013) . The main concern of advertising is to disseminate the information to mass in a short time through various print and electronic media but major challenge was the selection of medium/ vehicle to advertise. Advertisement‘s effects or output s are usu ally measured in terms of brand awareness (Selvakumar, 2014) .  H3: Advertising has positive impact on building Traditional Integrated Marketing Communication.   Sales P romotion  Sales promotion is basically a small push to have more sale of a particular product which usually results in more revenue and brand preference while selecting the products to buy (Hartley & Pickton, 2010) . Sales promotional activities are mainly helping and pushing actual and potential customers to take quick decisions to buy, making more an d repeat ed purchases (Michael J. Valos, Vanya Louise Maplestone, 2017) . Even marketers dealing in business to business trade are also promoting through trade shows, event marketing, sponsorships,  special prices, or discounts but use of technology was limited to certain areas of operations (Kalyan Raman and Prasad A. Naik, 1991) .   H4: Sales Promotion has positive impact on building Traditional Integrated Marketing Communication.   Public Relation  Public relation is an integral part of promotional strategy of the organization. This approach is the most cost effective preposition which results in long term customer‘s association with the company (Hilde A.M.  Voorveld, 2019) . The main functionality of public relation towards customer is to communicate about new introduced products , repositioning of the service or product, influencing new target customer, and reshaping the product and company‘s overall brand  image (Victor A
	. Barger & Lauren I. 
	 55  Labrecque, 2013) . IMC facilitates all the functionality of public relation smooth ly and timely (Jerry G. Kliatchko, 2009) .    H5: Public Relation has positive  impact on building Traditional Integrated Marketing Communication.   Direct Marketing  To bridge the gap between marketer and customer, direct marketing strategy works best to cover this gap and create s  awareness about the product portfolio of company (Victor A. Barger & Lauren I. Labrecque, 2013 ). Various mediums or channels are being  used to deliver personalized or customized promotio nal materials (Hilde A.M. Voorveld, 2019) . In the modern era, direct marketing with internet covering wide range of customers globally whereas before internet of digitalization it was restricted to a location (Luangrath, Andrea Webb Peck, Joann Barger, 2017) .   H6: Direct Marketing has positive impact  on building Traditional Integrated Marketing Communication.   Modern  Integrated Marketing Communication (MIMC)  MIMC is strategic approach that consists and integrates various communication channels to be more interactive to convey the message. MIMC facilitates new way of transferring or sharing information on multiple plat forms and messages reach to actual and potential customers within seconds (Philip J. K itchen & Don E. Schultz b, 2009) . Marketers have divided MIMC strategy into four stages to get best result out of it. The first stage focuses on content creation and tactical coordination  rather than hiring advertising agency (Amanda Zwerin, Theresa B. Clarke & Irvine Clarke III, 2019) . The second stage evaluates and monitors  the communication practices selectedconsidering customers‘ needs, wants, and evaluating the customers‘ feedback (Ogechi Adeola, Robert Ebo Hinson, 2020) . The third stage monitor s regular flow of information and finally fourth stage implements MIMC at organizational level strategically and ensure s that all the department working together with coordination to broadcast a coherent organization‘s brand image (Claudia Elisabeth Henninger, Panayiota J. Alevizou, 2017) . The main focus of MIMC is to work and integrate traditional IMC with social media through digital platforms and focusing on cost effective and result oriented approach (Šerić, 2017) .  H2: Modern Integrated Marketing Communication  has posit ive impact on building brand equity   Social Media (SM)  A rapid change in digital media is facilitating platforms for social communication with and without face to face interaction which is providing useful information and ease of use to customers. Social m edia is a key role player in influencing and attracting consumers‘ behaviour and perception towards products or brands (Duffet & Wakeham, 2016; Aydin, 2020; Ibrahim, Aljarah&Ababneh, 2020 ). Social media seems to be more influential than the normal or traditional marketing communication techniques ( Lepkowska , Parsons and Berg , 2019 ; Sümer, 2020 ). Consumers search product‘s information and reviews on social media platforms (Cheung, et al., 2019) . Some social media supports customised marketing of products and services offer ed to customer toconsumer, business to business, and finally results in brand building (Swani, Brown, and Milne, 2014; Fonseca,Duarte& Gustavo, 2020 ). Social media communication is being used by marketers in their marketing strategies. Surprisingly, more t han 90 percent of  business es or marketers are using social media platforms like Instagram, Pinterest, Twitter, Google+, LinkedIn, Facebook, Youtube, Whatsapp, Tumblr and other social media to create awareness and attract the new customers (Yurdakul & Bozdağ, 2018; Khan, 2017; Shiva& Singh, 2019 ).  H7: Social Media has positive  impact on building Modern Integrated Marketing Commu nication.   Digital Marketing  Digitalization has brought a revolutionary change in data management, media management and finally in business
	. Digital media at global pace was estimated around 38.3 percent in 2017 and mobile advertising which is the most popular medium account s for 63.3 percent of digital advertisement spending (eMarketer, 2017). Digital marketing provide s wider  coverage of customer base and provide s insights  to even smaller segment of 
	 56  customer base (Selvakumar, 2014) . Content marketing is an integral part of digital marketing which focuses o n creating and distributi ng relevant , consistent and valuable content to attract new customers and retain them ( Rocha  et al.,  2019; Dinis, Breda& Barreiro, 2020) . In fact Search Engine optimization (SEO) and blogs are also growing its presence among customers ( Amatulli, Angelis & Stoppani , 2019; Alves, Sousa &Machado, 2020) . Approximately 72 percent marketers state that search engine optimization is the most effective tactic , whereas approximately 32 percent consider content marketing as an effective tool in digital marketing (Yurdakul & Bozdağ, 2018 ; Adeyinka  et al., 2020 ).   H8: Digital Marketing  has positive impact on building Modern Integrated Marketing Communication.   Advertising  Before digitalization, advertising elements of IMC were totally dependent on physical materials and one way communication or non -personal communication. The current situation is totally different in terms of communication, customers‘ level of information, needs and wants of information in adverti sing and moreover customer seeks everything quick or immediately (Michael John Valos Fatemeh Haji Habibi Riza Casidy Carl Barrie Driesener Vanya Louise Maplestone, 2016) . Modern era of technology provides these all solutions and multi -fold results i n terms of quick information about new launch, interactive - two way communication, after sales service (Ogechi Adeola, Robert Ebo Hinson, 2020) . Digital marketing including social m edia has provedto be a  great support in modern advertising which provide s  all solution at one place (James G. Hutton, 2010) .   Digital marketing facilitate s  advertising in terms of widespread and personalization of messages, time and cost effective ness,  more impactful, targeted, more interactive and responsive, building strong brand with less time frame, less use of resources and finally results in more retu rn on investment (Michael J. Valos, Vanya Louise Maplestone, 2017) .  H9: Advertising has positive impact on building Modern Integrated Marketing Communication.   Sales Promotion  Promotion through social  media and other digital marketing tool s  provide s a wide range of customer and work on multi -dimensional approach using digital self -promotional tools, products reviews, price based promotion campaign, loyalty programmes, drop shopping incentives and rese ller promotion (Michael John Valos Fa temeh Haji Habibi Riza Casidy Carl Barrie Driesener Vanya Louise Maplestone, 2016) . Traditional sales promotion was a short term increment in sales and has covered  only a particular market segment whereas digital sales promotion is constant and having w ide coverage because of huge traffic on social media platforms with less expensive and fastresults (Kalyan Raman and Prasad A. Naik, 1991) .    H10: Sales Promotion has positive impact on building Modern Integrated Marketing Communication.   Public Relation  Modern digital marketing tools are focusing on building professional network between salespeople and company and / or corporate to corporate (Hilde A.M. Voorveld, 2019) . These modern tools of integrated marketing communication tools also support marketing research, strengthen buyer - seller relationships, focusing on public flow of information on development in corporate governance, and promote customer relationship manag ement (Wang, Pauleen, and Zhang, 2016). Digital content marketing is supporting significantly in public relations (Ogechi Adeola, Robert Ebo Hinson, 2020) .    H11: Public Relation h as positive impact  on building Modern Integrated Marketing Communication.   Direct Marketing  Digital marketing has been  proved to be the best supporting element for direct marketing which is being done through emails, e brochures, and spreading information through social media to actual and potential customers (Michael John Valos Fatemeh Haji Habibi Riza Casidy Carl Barrie Driesener Vanya Louise Maplestone , 2016) 
	. In the modern  era of technological advancement phase, marketers are using face to face communication and textual paralanguage (Hilde A.M. Voorveld, 2019) . Textual paralanguage includes 
	 57  nonverbal audible, visual elements that usually replace written language like symbols, images (emoji and stickers, etc.), and words like alternants (norm ally used in Whatsapp chat and differentiators like haha, ohh hoo) (Luangrath, Andrea Webb Peck, Joann Barger, 2017) .    H12: Direct Marketing  has positive impact on building Modern Integrated Marketing Communication   Figure -1: Conceptual model and Hypotheses    Source: Author‘s Observations   RESEARCH METHODOLOGY  This study is focused on tourism and hospitality industry of Himachal Pradesh. The survey method for opinion collection is conducted to study the impact of integrating digital and social media into traditional IMC to create brand equity ( Adeyinka,et al., 2020) .

The correlation coefficients matrix of constructs under this research in the above table -2 reflects that the correlation coefficients values in the above table are not so high therefore the issue of multicollinearity situation does not occur. The average v ariance extracted (AVE) score of all constructs are more than 0.50 which reflects the mean of squared loadings for all indicators are allied with constructs. Similarly, the constructs 
	 59  explain above 50% variance in its items thus, convergent validity of all  constructs has been established successfully (Hair, Sarstedt, Ringle, et al., 2012). Likewise, the shared variance of all constructs with other constructs are greater than its AVE therefore, discriminants validity is established (Fornell and Larcker, 1981 ; Sarstedt, Ringle, et al., 2014). The composite reliability values of all constructs are falling between 0.80 and 0.89 which is  more than 0.70 and less than 0.95 therefore internal consistency reliability is proven (Sarstedt, Ringle, et al., 2014). Cronb ach‘s Alpha values are more than 0.70 for all constructs which denote the data passed the reliability test (DeVellis, 2003).

It represents that the impact of modern IMC is quite higher than traditional IMC in creating brand equity in tourism and hospitality business. Social media and digi tal 
	 60  media plays vital roles in achieving the marketing objectives of an organization whereas there is negative impact of advertising, sales promotion, and publication on modern IMC. Similarly, advertising, sales promotion, and direct marketing have positiv e impact on traditional IMC.   The above table -4 indicates results of bootstrapping procedure with (512 cases, 5000 subsamples, and no sign change option). This indicates that hypothesis H5 is rejected which means there is insignificant impact of public relation tool of IMC on traditional IMC in context of tourism and hospitality business. However, rest all hypotheses H1, H2, H3, H4, H6, H7, H8, H9, H10, H11, and H12 are significant and accepted. This reflects that both traditional IMC and modern IMC have significant impact on Brand equity however, modern IMC has more impact than traditional one. Similarly, advertising, sales promotion, and direct marketing have significant impact on traditional IMC. Likewise, advertising, sales promotion, public relation, d irect marketing, social media, and digital marketing have significant impact on Modern IMC. This reveals that modern IMC is more powerful than Traditional IMC for creating brand equity in tourism and hospitality industry.   FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION  Marketin g programs are directly aimed to increase sale however, indirectly it is done to create brand equity. Brand equity is an assets which also plays roles in amalgamation and merger. Integrated  marketing communication provides us a holistic marketing tools to reach target customers whereas modern IMC is more effective than traditional IMC which is proven from our empirical analysis. Most of the tools under traditional IMC have become obsolete to reach audience. Today, marketer s are trying to reach customers in more customized way because every customer is different. Interest and preference of customers varies therefore, selection of tools to reach target prospect has to been done very tactically. Digital generation is hanging with digital devices most of the tim e. It is not possible to reach this segment through traditional tools of IMC. The modern IMC tools can helps us to overcome  this problem. Social media and digital marketing have been proven the most effective tools of modern IMC. These both tools are cost  effective because of accountability of such platform advertisers. These both platforms provide us more customized service to reach targetted segment of customers and paymentis purely based on reach of customers. These both platforms allows us to fix date,  time and budget, and also allow us to characterise target audience & their locations. Modern IMC has assimilated all tools available in old IMC along with modern tools which provide us to reach both conservative and digital consumers. Thus, modern IMC all ows us to reach old fashioned consumers also who can still be connected through traditional tools.   Theoretical Implications  Though, the existence of literature in this area is numerous however, there was gap in integration of digital and social media into  integrated marketing communication. The existing studies were mostly carried out on traditional tools of IMC. This study has integrated both digital platforms of marketing to reach every segments of customers. It has also identified some of the tools whic h may not be useful for IMC of tourism and hospitality organisations. Tourism and hospitality industries marketers can neglect those tools for integrated marketing communications. This study ha s also proven that the  traditional IMC is less effective than modern IMC. This has provided a new framework of understanding modern integrated marketing communication application for today‘s digital and competitive environment.   This supports the study of (Valos, Maplestone, Polonsky, & Ewing, 2017)  who has firstly integrated social media into IMC. This also supports the study of (Shafi & Madhavaiah, 2013; Selvakumar, 2014) who have proven that integrate marketing commination helps to gain brand equity
	. This also supports the study of (Brunello, 2013 ; Mongkol, 2014)  who has studied the importance of IMC in creat ion of brand equity of service organisations.   Practical Implications  The aim is to provide a way to reach target customers effectively integrating social media and digital marketing within IM C to create brand equity in the digital era. Th is paper  also provides the impact of each tools in traditional and modern IMC which helps marketing managers to choose effective tools as per their 
	 61  objectives and characteristics of audience. This study provid es solution to manager who f ace difficulty  in deciding which media should be selected for communicating targeted audience. This will also  helps to integrate social media where customer created content can be used for creating brand equity. This paper will assist senior marketing manager to frame marketing strategies for their offerings.   CONCLUSION  The basic agenda of this paper is to add digital tools into the most practicedintegrated marketing communication tools. The idiom ‗old is gold‘ may not work for  longer therefore we keep on modernising our existing system. The modern technologies are more efficient than older. Likewise, integration of social media and digital media into traditional integrated marketing communication have upgraded it tomodern integ rated marketing communication. This study concludes that both new tools of IMC contribute better than the existing tools therefore it is requirement of these days for successful marketing activities. Marketing managers should use modern IMC tools rather th an continuing with the older one. These tools will helps to reduce IMC budgets and achieve organisational objectives. The tools provides flexibility of payment and helps to target audience more efficiently.  The limitations of thisresearchis the location o f study i.e. Himachal Pradesh state of India. However, the participants in this study are from every corner of India therefore, we can generalised the outcome in context of India. This study is focused on hospitality and tourism business which can also be studied on another segments of business like FMCG, Fashion, Automobile, electronics, etc.   REFERENCES  Aaker, D.A.

The qualitative ap proach is used by in -depth interviews with 45 participants from media leaders, journalists, vloggers, and audiences. Besides, contents analyses are conducted on 48 samples of various media series along one year. The results showed that big data analytics w as conducted for data -driven journalism step by step at national and local media in Indonesia. However, the knowledge and understanding of big data analytics and data -driven journalism in the newsroom and research supporters are still not adequate for both  policy and technology. This study suggests the model development of the data -driven journalism process from Indonesia's experience and has managerial implications on empowering data -driven journalism in Indonesia.   Keywords: Data -driven Journalism, Big Data Analytics, Indonesian Media N ewsroom.   INTRODUCTION  Changes in the technological environment continue without interruption for each generation. In viewpoint generation, technology is called new media, but for generations after that, there is the emergence of newer and newer media. Therefore, changes in the technological environment must be part of an increasingly better and more beneficial social change. Technology also changes the way individuals, groups, communities, organizations, and communities in large aggregates interact, communicate, and transact. In formation and communication technology specifically has changed the way business is done, how to produce, and to distribute its results throughout the world.   Journalism is one of the essential tasks of modern society to maintain each other so that contin uity is preserved in modern democratic human relations harmoniously to protect planet earth. The way of working, producing, distributing, and presenting in the world of journalism is also changing. Developments also occur in journalists, media organization s, work tools, data sources and resources, data search and collection, crafting, and presentation platforms. Likewise, innovations occur part of the public, and the audience concept becomes participants due to massive collaboration in all the above process es among all stakeholders. This transformation, from the perspective of Bhatt, Goyal & Yadav (2018), especially concerning social media and the society, is an "important aspect which is authentic and helpful for the development and growth of the society."   Inevitably there is intense competition between media institutions themselves and media institutions with grass -roots media. Now everyone is dealing with other individuals and media organizations fighting over viewers. The landscape of journalism is evolv ing, and each participant must be able to adjust to that terrible change. On the other hand, technology has been helping and shaping the way of producing content. Carlson (2015) said that most news content is 
	 66  automated, and this determines how this situati on creates new challenges for journalists. This development became a "technological drama" of the potential of news technology related to the future problems of the journalistic workforce, rigid conformity between the form of news composition, and the norm ative foundation of journalistic authority.   The work of a journalist - like all other professions in all fields of life - is assisted by information and communication technology devices. Computer -mediated communication is a part of life that is inseparabl e from journalism. Previous studies have given in -depth attention to the availability of information resources in the cloud data. Information, the contents of earth and planets, is in the cloud that can be accessed by anyone, including journalists. Accordi ng to Cheruiyot, Baack & Ferrer -Conill (2019), data journalism is now beyond legacy media, which needs a variety of actors within and outside the old media organizations. However, this previous research still discussed the new challenges for journalism, wh ile our paper is more focused on practical models in the field.   Meanwhile, big data appears and grows as part of human life, and any field is always associated with this concept because all human activities on planet Earth are recorded and documented in it. Thus, big data is a social, cultural, and technological phenomenon - which, according to Lewis &Westlund (2015), is a complex amalgamation of digital data abundance, emerging analytic techniques, mythology about data -driven insights, and growing critic ism of the overall consequences of big -data practices for democracy and society. However, Lewis and Westlund's view is still very philosophically fundamental about big data and journalism.   One of the most relevant issues regarding the growth and adoption of big data in journalism is about policy and the way models and streams of data journalism work practically. The model and flow of data journalism become essential at the information gathering, screening, production, and news presentation stages. Data jou rnalism practices, especially the use of large data sets, could be used in many newsrooms. Uskali&Kuutti (2015) suggested three different models are needed for regulating data journalism work practices such as the traditional data desk model, the flexible data projects model, and the entrepreneur model (sub -contractor model). This thinking needs to be developed, and this study discusses models and streams of data journalism based on the principles of big data analytics.   Previous studies show a diversity of  perspectives to discuss journalism data or the relationship between big data and journalism. Parasie&Dagiral (2013) who researched the role of "computer -assisted -reporters" and "programmer -journalists" in Chicago, USA, called the era of computer -mediated journalism as the revival era of "programmer -journalist" because journalists were armed with information technology skills and artifacts that influenced the way traditional journalism was expected to contribute to the public welfare. This research is essen tial as a reference because the direction was to find a "programmer -journalist" model, but the focus was more on efforts to strengthen democracy and transparency.   In Canada, Hermida& Young (2017) tried to open unicorn data as the basis of journalism data research by mentioning it as a hierarchy of hybridity in data and computational journalism. This unicorn basis has roles in influenced norms, practices, and news organizations. Then the hierarchy of hybridity is essential to see the concept of developing journalism data as a new way of working.   Data journalism is a form of investigative journalism that continues to grow. As in many other countries in the world, on the European continent, such as in Sweden, Appelgren& Nygren (2014) explained that data jour nalism began to be adopted into "old" organizations because journalism was something newly introduced as a genre of journalism
	. Previously, this form of data journalism was known as computer -based reporting and data -based journalism, as well as journalism of precision, computing, or database. However, Appelgren& Nygren only introduced new methods and genres of journalism into "old" organizations. As new methods and genres of journalism into "old" organizations may be similar in various countries, but our pa per wants to formulate a model of Indonesia's experience.  
	 67   Problems encountered are in the form and content. In the UK, Knight (2015) found data journalism practiced for its visual appeal and the quality of its investigations, and the overall impact, espec ially in the tabloid format, was decorative and informative. In the Guardian's big data journalism, content as evidence from creative reportage work in the UK media, according to Tandoc Jr. & Oh (2017), was related to aspects of norms, values, and routines . As the most popular media in the UK, The Guardian is a pioneer in contemporary big data journalism. His findings showed that big data journalism exhibited new trends in how sources were used, but still, in general, adhered to traditional news values and formats such as objectivity and visual use.   Further, in subsequent studies, Borges -Rey (2017) highlighted media at the local level in the UK, such as Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, and discovered different characters based on three conceptual lenses such as materiality, performativity, and reflexivity. This perspective was considered in developing the model of this paper. However, research by De Maeyer et al. (2015) in Belgium, was still discussing the fundamental concept of the growth of data journalism, specifically in the French -language media. According to De Meyer, data journalism could be understood as a socio -discursive practice, not only in the production of artifacts alone but also in the eloquent efforts of all the actors involved in the newsroom.   As a comparison, other previous papers, and the development of similar research in Asia, especially in China, will provide a different perspective because the system and ideology of the country are different from the general Western democrati c system. However, in China, the diffusion of data journalism as journalistic innovation also develops. The issue is more complicated than in Western countries if data journalism is applied in socialist -communist countries. In China, the media system has a  complexity problem where the inheritance of Chinese quantitative reporting traditions is inadequate, and practitioners have difficulty with the availability of data. Nevertheless, researchers such as Zhang & Feng (2019) had different beliefs and opinions about data journalism that were apparently locally adapted and historically embedded in China, and what facilitated or inhibited them. However, the strengths and weaknesses of previous papers are used as contributions to develop a model in this study.   All things can be reported through social media, and it is often difficult to distinguish between fake and fact news so that journalism data can be the answer. In the South Asian region, such as India, news that is based on facts and quality needed to deal w ith the tide of fake news circulating in the community. Narula (2019) stated, "data journalism is the need of the hour to move from fake news to verifiable and reliable news rooted in facts. It would allow reporting an incident based on the facts as well a s allow readers to examine the facts." Social media tends to be preferred by netizens over official channels. WhatsApp is considered more effective for sharing news (Kabha et al., 2019). Jamil (2019) also examined the practice of data journalism in Pakista n, whose use is increasing following the development of software, algorithms, programming, and data processing techniques by media organizations. Nielsen et al. (2016) see the challenges and opportunities for news media and journalism is increasingly digit al, mobile, and social media environments. However, our study does not explicitly discuss the role of social media but rather the broader context that underpins social media: using big data.   As an analogy at the global level, research conducted by Heravi (2018) was a summary of results from the global data journalism survey of data journalism at the global level, which included the participation of journalists from 43 countries
	. Heravi explained various aspects of data journalism practices throughout the world, including demographics, skills, education, and the formation of data teams, as well as opportunities and values related to data journalism. In its current growth, the best practice of data journalism is needed, as a mechanism of expertise and skills to develop this environment.   Overall, in the context of big data and journalism, media and communication scholars have begun examining and theorizing about big data in the circumstances of media and public life at large, both regarding the 
	 68  specific implic ations for journalism, and the consequences of collaboration in presenting information among all stakeholders. All previous papers showed great attention to the development and practice of data journalism in various places around the world. However, they h ad not yet paid attention to how the conception and practice of journalism in big data analytics as a database of journalism in media institutions, and to understand the habits of journalists working with big data and the policy in building resources for d ata journalism. This study takes a position in the gap that has not been filled.   Based on the background above, the research aims, first, to analyze the understanding and practice of journalists regarding infrastructure data. Second, to analyze media inst itutions conduct data structuring. Third, to analyze journalists and media institutions conduct data deepening, enrichment, and presentation in the media. Finally, to analyze media institutions in perceiving the importance of resource management and develo ping data journalism models.   CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK  Big data and Data -driven Journalism  This concept of explication analyzes the relationship between big data and data journalism. Big data is the basis for almost all fields of business, including advocacy a nd public services, through the power of journalism. However, operational institutions, public institutions such as media corporations consider the management of their organizations of the companies. The term "big data" in media corporation has attention i n fields of life and is discussed in broad scope, including in its derivation for the term data journalism. Kalyvas& Overly (2014) summarized what big data is:   Big data is a process to provide insight into decision making. This process uses people and technology to quickly analyse large amounts of data of various types (structured data with traditional tables and unstructured data, such as images, videos, emails, transaction data, and social media interactions) from various sources to produce actionable kn owledge flows.   Based on the definition, it reflected how much data is collected every second and continues to grow to be accommodated in cloud computers. Contemporary journalists use various digital tools and services to collect, manage, and process infor mation for public consumption. Even data journalism is considered as a new genre that brings change. Data journalism is welcomed by many because of the availability of data in digital form and the number of efficient online tools. Everything can help users  to analyze, visualize, and publish large amounts of data (Veglis&Maniou, 2018).   Meaning data, according to Mayer -Schönberger&Cukier (2013), is no longer considered static, rigid or staled — the benefits are completed once the collection objectives are re ached, such as after the aircraft has landed (or in the case of Google, after a search request has been processed). Instead, data becomes the raw material of business, vital economic input, which is used to create new forms of economic value. Even with the  right mindset, data can be cleverly reused, chosen with humility, willingness, and listening instruments. All data that contains information and is suitable for the public to know is the raw material for journalism data.   Large amounts of raw data are sto red on internal servers and web servers around the world, but only what is needed has valuable information to be withdrawn and presented to the public. Referral data journalism is the search and processing of data for journalism that relies on computer mac hines. It is like a journalist assisted by a machine to guide him in producing news, even Carlson (2015) called it a robot reporter. A nickname was given because the automatic style of journalism forced a redefinition of the workforce, the form of composit ion, and changing authority of journalism
	. The term "automatic journalism" indicated an algorithmic process that transforms data into narrative news texts with limited human intervention outside of initial programming choices. The consequences of increasin g the ability of news texts that are written by machine signify a new possibility for a news content field that far exceeds the ability of human journalist production.   Journalists must realize that in this era of big data, the news reports will be more in fluential for public trust and transparency. Then, today, 
	 69  big data has become a necessity as the basis of journalism. Mayer -Schönberger&Cukier (2013) also explained that big data caused a revolution that would change the way we live, work, and think about things that were of an individual or other people's interest. Therefore, big data had the potential to influence society and science, how to produce and share experiences, and how to make decisions after receiving near -perfect information.   Debate about determination information technology into journalism, and it makes it a dichotomy between before and after the adoption of technology. However, it is essential to follow the thinking of Witschge et al. (2016), that instead of drawing a dividing line betwee n traditional journalism and the future, mainstream and alternative, digital and nondigital journalism - where this condition shows the complexity and diversity of contexts and journalistic practices - it is better to understand fundamental changes in the field of journalism over several last decades due to various factors. Not merely technological issues as a causal factor, but also cultural, social, or economic changes make journalism find its place.   Another term put forward beside data journalism is dig ital journalism. It appears earlier, and the scope of meaning is broader than data journalism, but the practice of both in the field is the same. Josephi in Witschge et al. (2013) stated that digital journalism was not born from anywhere, but rather grew f rom technical possibilities and, in a short period, has changed the face of journalism, especially in North America, Europe, and Australia. Globally, traditional journalism is still in control, and for this reason, digital journalism must be seen concernin g traditional journalism rather than in isolation.   Further and more contemporary, researchers like Lewis (2017) explained that journalism in the era of big data is a way of viewing journalism as an interpolation through a conceptual and methodological ap proach to calculation and quantification in the form of rows of numbers or visual graphics. However, the way to discuss journalism data must be comprehensive, including its practices and philosophies. Thus, it also means paying attention to the socio -cultu ral dynamics of previous calculations and quantifications. According to Anderson (2016), the breadth of the horizon means recognizing that big data algorithms and computational tools and techniques are not entirely material nor fully human but hybrids way of journalism. This issue, by Lewis and Usher (2013), was discussed as the role of technology in the newsroom, specifically the introduction of open -source culture.   Data -driven Journalism and Its Role in Society  The distribution and adoption of digital handheld devices can be stated to be evenly distributed throughout the world. Likewise, in Indonesia, smartphones and other gadgets are part of everyone's attributes, whether in urban, suburban, or even rural areas because telecommunications infrastructure i s generally evenly distributed in a country consisting of thousands of islands in Southeast Asia. The distribution of digital devices to tens of millions of populations in countries with rapidly increasing education levels provides opportunities for the gr owth and development of big data in the national context of Indonesia.   Every smartphone owner is a productive person to create content and then share it with others, groups, communities, and the public. Currently, institutional media in Indonesia produce content by considering the role of viewers or similar collaborative mechanisms in citizen journalism. The public is increasingly media literate and increasingly smart as both citizen -producers and viewers to handle public issues. Tong & Zuo (2019) said that because of the social constructivism nature of data journalism, serving the public interest and building democracy is a more appropriate principle and objectivity for data journalism
	.   Journalism is undergoing digitization, changing from analog to digita l bits. Besides, it is also experiencing digitalization, which captures how journalism is restructured by digital communication and media infrastructure (Brennen &Kreiss, 2018). The purpose of data journalism is threefold, "enabling the audience to find re levant information personally, uncovering extraordinary and previously unknown stories and helping the audience to understand better 
	 70  complex problems" (Hermida& Young, 2019). This explication is more practical because, previously, according to Royal & Blas ingame (2015), the term "data journalism" began to be used instead of the more traditional "computer -assisted reporting" or "computational journalism" — a term that might be frightening to some journalists.   Royal &  Blasingame (2015) described the development of journalism data, which later became a topic of academic research in various developed countries. Royal (2010; 2012) also explicitly examined and published a case study team of The New York Times Interactive News, spending one -week interviewing team members and studying the process of adopting journalism data. Identification of unique skills, workflows, and culture of an organization was identified and integrated with storytelling, combining quantification and quality concern. In another case, Royal (2013) also examined the diffusion analysis of the interaction of Olympic activities in The New York Times  from time to time. Other researchers such as Parasie and Dagiral (2013) studied data -based journalism in the Chicago Tribune  and found that practitioner programmer -journalists had provided new ways for journalism to deal with social kindness.   As Coddington (2015) stated, professional journalism was historically built from two elements, such as textual and visua l. From this primary character, three forms of quantitative journalism emerged, namely computer -assisted reporting, data journalism, and computational journalism, all of which often overlap and diverge in the context of values and practices. Hammond (2015)  also mentioned the use of data and computers in contemporary journalism, which gave rise to various terms such as data ( -driven) journalism, computational journalism, programmer journalism, algorithmic journalism, robot reporting, and automated journalism . However, it is also characterized by a post -objective professional mindset that emphasizes the transparency of editorial processes, user integration, and new qualitative epistemological values from large data sets. Transparency is a quality management st rategy by sharing an approach to gathering information with users. The new epistemological value of large data sets is that knowledge is obtained inductively by exploring data, discussing initial findings, and detecting meaningful data patterns with the assistance of algorithms (Rinsdorf& Boers, 2016). However, all the support instruments basically must be aimed at building a society that grows its democracy through transparency.   METHODS  This paper focuses on answering the following research questions: fir st, what is the understanding and practice of journalists regarding infrastructure data? Second, how do media institutions conduct data structuring? Then, how do journalists and media institutions conduct data deepening, enrichment, and presentation in the  media? Furthermore, finally, how do media institutions perceive the importance of resource management regarding data journalism?   A qualitative approach is used to collect data in addition to the literature review. In -depth interviews were conducted with participants from several categories or levels in organizations and audiences such as media institutions, journalists, and ordinary viewers and news or events vloggers. At a media institution category, participants were taken from the chief editor or edito r in chief of the media institution or manager or at the level of the reporting coordinator. In the journalist category, participants were taken from various types of media, such as television, online, radio, and newspapers. In the viewer category, ordinar y people were taken as readers, news viewers in television, print, or online media. A few viewers were also members of the community who were actively producing and sharing content on YouTube as vloggers.   Based on these categories, this study gathered 45 participants consisting of seven managers or coordinators of national media coverage, five from local media in several provinces, five television journalists, two from radio, seven online, and five newspaper journalists
	. There are seven non -vloggers viewer s and seven vloggers -viewers.   Open -ended questions were arranged in general and specifically addressed to each participant category. Some open -ended question items generally related to the 
	 71  research objectives discussed in this paper, namely, to find out p recisely and in -depth about a few groups of indicators such as first, journalists' understanding and practice regarding infrastructure data. Second, practices of media institutions in conducting data structuring, then the practices of journalists and media  institutions in conducting data deepening, enrichment, and presenting in their media. Moreover, finally, opinions and policies of media institutions regarding the importance of resource management related to data journalism.   In addition to the in -depth interview technique, there were also observations and contents analyzes on various media that were the work of active groups of workers and viewers. Observations were made at each media office, and content analysis was carried out on news manuscripts in ea ch media whose samples were taken from 12 months in 2019 with a sample of one edition each month, to obtain a sample of four types of media multiplied by 12 editions, which produced 48 editions media content. In every media content, the news is searched us ing data journalism style such as included quantitative data and visual, and weekly trending topics rank.   In-depth interviews and content analysis pay attention to coding on each indicator (Kalyvas& Overly, 2014; Henry & Venkatraman, 2015), such as first, data infrastructure includes data domain, intelligent business domain, statistical domain, the home page, sentiment page, and weather page. Second, data structuring  includes key -value stores, column -based stores, graph -based stores, docs -based stores, sentiment analysis, trending topics, and recommender systems, social media -language detection, social media -named entity recognition, data validation -parameters, data v alidation -methods, and data validation -results. Third, deepening and qualitative enrichment data includes news craft and improvement, in -depth interviews and confirmation, and performance optimization —finally, the resource management, and sustainable devel opment policy of data -driven journalism.  Data processing of the results of the interview is the primary data, which is the subject of analysis in addition to content analysis. Both are combined to describe adoption in practice and reasoning about data jour nalism in Indonesia. Data triangulation was carried out on interview transcripts, and summaries related to each context were presented in the results.   RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  Data Infrastructures in Media Institution  As the concept of explication before, b ig data is concerned with the existence of large, complex and ever -growing data sets that are enriched and derived from a variety of Table 1.

	 72  independent sources (Wu et al., 2014), such as from environmental and body sensors, cellular devices, administrative claims  data, social media, email, laboratory studies, electronic medical records, internet, business transactions, and geospatial devices or sensors (Gerard et al., 2014, Barton, 2016; Chan, 2013). Big-data growth rates are high -speed, and it can be produced by machines or humans (Henry & Venkatraman, 2015). From this understanding, it means that all journalism activities are categorized as the work to build big data from time to time. Journalists' job is to create and store data on a continuity basis.   Most esta blished media institutions have a data infrastructure that is used as an operational base to produce, distribute, and present news or articles on various topics. However, some media institutions are not pioneering to build their infrastructure, and the wor k takes time in line with the development of their respective media. Some local media in the area have been acquired or established by national media business groups so that the infrastructure data is also centered on the holding company. One of the influe ntial media institutions in Indonesia, Tempo Media Corporation, which publishes Tempo Newsletter or Koran Tempo , has a robust data infrastructure base and has long been known as the Tempo Data Centre (TDC). B. Setyarso, editor in chief of Koran Tempo  expla ined:   In the media institutions where we work, the existence  of data is essential. However, often journalists are overwhelmed to search, find, and process them. We have a research team to serve the editorial team. The seconded researchers are tasked with processing unstructured data into mature data and ready to be displayed in news presentations. They are also a capable visualization team that is equipped with the latest applications, including animation.   Tempo Data Center (TDC) is accessed by the public to search for data and information from various fields, so that educated people often come to conduct studies. Several other media institution groups are working hard to build their infrastructure data and thus have not yet opened public access for this purpose. N. B. Nugroho, head of the multimedia department at Media Indonesia  newspaper explained:   We often discuss big data as a topic of internal discussion, but indeed among the journalists, no one mastere d what  big data is and how it works. We had invited experts to discuss it, but in the discussion, there was a kind of gap, because the experts were information technology people while we as journalists were very diverse in their backgrounds.   Many practiti oners of journalism, especially journalists themselves, are not aware that they have a role in building big data that is concentrated in the media institutions where they work. Journalists feel that they only work by collecting data through interviews, checking the internet to enrich writing, and submitting it to proofreading for later publication. However, some of them also realize the importance of building big data for data journalism.   Implementation of big data systems in media institutions is critica l because, in that system, we will find home page views, sentiment pages, or even weather pages as a standard measure. However, it was found that the display of quantitative data often lacks in the narrative that gives deep meaning to graphic visuals. Rese arch by Cushion, Lewis & Callaghan (2017) also found that statistics are often referred to in news coverage, but their role in interpreting situations is often unclear, lacking, and inaccurate. F. Pratama, the managing editor of Detikcom , explained the online news homepage he led:   Like our print newspaper edition, the online edition that is sought  on the homepage is a graphic display that is attractive and easily understood by the public. This data display is the result of processing from the graphic team whose materials are prepared by the research team or from the journalists themselves
	. Often, we also cite outside sources to be presented on the front page.   The data infrastructure of media institutions or the public can always rely on open access, includ ing social media and institutions of 
	 73  statistical centers and the like. However, what is most talked about is digital journalism and social media producing large amounts of digital content every day, journalism scholars faced with new challenges to describe  and analyze the wealth of information. Günther & Quandt (2016) illustrated this practice assuming a workflow of rule -based approaches, dictionaries, supervised machine learning, document grouping, and topic models. Arifin Asydhad, editor in chief of Kumpa ran.com  explained the appearance of the online news homepage he led:   Our online news homepage must be attractive, so viewers do not get bored visiting our site all the time. There is always something new and variations on the headlines and visual appearan ce. The main points of the identity and visual character of our website must still be there to be easily recognized by anyone. Our online news homepage is in the top ten on the number of viewers and their active involvement in the issues that interest them .  Often, sentiment analysis is carried out on data collected from the Internet and various social media platforms. Politicians and governments often use sentiment analysis to understand how people feel about themselves and their policies . Ilham Safutra, head of the Jawa Pos  newspaper coverage which also has a regional newspaper network in various provinces in Indonesia, explains:   Our media is very concerned about a topic that has an impact on public sentiment. However, so far, we have not been independent in processing sentiment analysis. The analysis needs external parties who usually do regular releases and hold press conferences for many media, and we are there. We try to do a text analysis process to interpret various data sources, su ch as viewers' opinions, but they are still limited.   Data Structuring Practices in Media Institutions  Data structuring is a big job that must be done by the media as an institution that advocates for the community, government, legislative, and judiciary i nstitutions. Structuring owned by the media must be several steps ahead of other institutions because the media supervision is inherent as a watchdog for the state administration policy. Therefore, understanding, adoption, and practice of key -value databas es in media institutions is a necessity for storing, retrieving, and managing associative arrays, and having data structures as a dictionary or hash table. Media institutions have dictionaries that contain a collection of objects, or historical editorial Table 2a.

	 74  records. All documents are stored and retrieved if needed by using a key that uniquely identifies the records and finds them quickly.   Media institutions in Indonesia relatively follow contemporary developments in the adoption of journalism, although it is still limited to large established media groups. However, significant work in data structuring as a key in data journalism is carried out by almost all institutional media, depending on the type. F.H. Santoso, general manager of research and development at  Kompas.id  said:   Our institution has long building data storage, and this is our basis, that in the development process, there is a digitization of the library from the conventional form, so we have gone through it. We have been building sophisticated dat a centers, crossing the developments from time to time, especially regarding Indonesia and the relevant international world. Now the development is at its optimum so that it has added value and is continuously being updated. The public can access our data center with digital services with only a small fee.   Some established media institutions such as Tempo Media  and Kompas Gramedia  in Indonesia are known as media institutions that have advanced big -data structures because they have been built over decades a nd become models of big data media institutions. Besides, several groups of media institutions in the region also have sufficientbig data because of their excellent inter -island networks, such as the Jawa Pos Network Group , the Media IndonesiaGroup , and th e Media Nusantara Citra  (MNC) Group. Ample data storage in media institutions illustrates its ability to handle data journalism at high speed, high volume, and high data varieties.   Technically, media institutions have distributed file systems, NoSQL databases, graph databases, and NewSQL databases where data is stored securely, and privacy protected. According to Strohbach et al. (2016), databases that are built must pay attention to  several things such as databases in memory, and column databases usually outperform traditional relational database systems. Also, the main technical barriers to widespread retrieval of large data storage solutions are missing standards. Moreover, there i s a need to address open research challenges related to scalability and graphical database performance. Problems faced by media institutions, especially the skills and knowledge of individual journalists, are generally still low to utilize the availability  of big data creatively and optimally. M. Hafizni, a senior journalist at MetroTV station, said:   We are used to processing qualitative data from interviews so that if there is data in the form of tables or graphics, we are often overwhelmed to discuss it in an argumentative language. The news material is too severe and scientific for us.  We often leave it to the research team whose part is to discuss it.   The same finding was also stated in research conducted by Young, Hermida & Fulda (2018), which showed that journalists had a lack of understanding and were less able to achieve the standard of excellence. Two main factors, which they should be familiar with (such as the use of free online options on Google Maps) turned out not to be easily adjusted, and th e number of practitioners working on data projects was mainly within the framework of traditional journalism. According to him, the most widely used visual elements were dynamic maps, graphics, and videos. Concerning interactivity, all but one of the proje cts contained interactive elements. The most popular interaction techniques were inspection and screening, which is considered an entry -level technique in the field of information visualization.   As a comparison of other research findings, Loosen et al. (2 017), examined, among other aspects, data sources and types, visualization, interactive features, topics, and producers in their research
	. The potential of data -based journalism was mainly aimed at community advocacy as a form of the social function of journalism. The existence of bar -charts was also commonplace in newspapers, magazines, or online news. Stalph (2018) also found the same thing after analyzing daily news from data -driven, which showed that daily journalism data illustrated two visualizations that tend to be bar charts. Most of these 
	 75  visualizations were not interactive, while maps turned out to be the most interactive type of visualization.   Sentiment analysis, trending topics, and recommender systems are the most vital elements and are widely adopted and discussed in journalism data. Likewise, in the eyes of viewers or online news users, trending topics are timely and are always sought every minute. The public is very enthusiastic to know and share about trending topics that occur on a daily or weekly basis. G. M. Sigit, the chief editor at MNC Radio Networks -MNC Sindo Trijaya FM , said:   At the news radio station, we work based on trending topics that occur, per minute, daily, up to a week. Even routinely in the week, we count trending topics that have the highest audience reception. Based on that, we do face -to-face events with customers or listeners such as live or on -air discussions on we ekends on the hottest topics of the week.   News and talk show radio pay attention to issues that are developing in society, and as such, journalists must work on the issue. Broadcasters need to be sensitive to what in the minds of the public or the communi ty of listeners. SindoTrijaya Radio  seeks to develop a more professional news broadcast platform and a more participatory online platform. Researchers such as Johnson & Dade (2019) refer to it as local broadcast journalism with more considerable attention to user -generated content and boundary work. Not only in the radio broadcast, television, and online broadcast industries, print media also routinely include trending topics from social media databases (especially Twitter) whose measurements are obtained f rom internal or external data. The journalistic algorithmic engine allows media institutions to map quickly.   Dörr (2016) did mapping in the field of algorithmic journalism based on the evolution of natural language generation (NLG). He explained that wit h software that automatically generates text from structured data, NLG transforms traditional news production into fast computer -based. The public wants to know what is happening around them by turning on the radio, even actively participating on -air. Appe lgren (2018) called this combination of human and computer machine sensitivity as hybrid journalism, namely contemporary data journalism that was inherent due to verbal and visual elements. Trending topics and sensitivity analysis were processed to be pres ented visually.   Table 2b.

	 76   The tendency of social media to be the basis for information retrieval is very dominant in the newsroom. Heravi& Harrower (2016) also stated that Twitter formed a source and verification process in the editorial room. Carlson (2018) mentioned that the role of social media, especially Facebook, in writing news tends to be confidential  and even haphazard. According to him, Facebook reacts to controversies with personalized writing, organized according to the popularity and involvement of its users. Most journalists do see the benefits of social media (Weaver &Willnat, 2016). The most co mmon short cut for individual journalists was to verify social media content because there was an emerging journalistic verification practice concerning social media (Brandtzaeg et al., 2016). Therefore, the source of social media is vital, and the media m ust conduct language detection and named entity recognition in the data structuring process. Lewis, Zamith&Hermida (2013) argued that an approach that combined computational and manual methods throughout the content analysis process could produce more usef ul and exciting results in a case study of news sources on Twitter to illustrate the hybrid approach.   Owned technology is directed to build social engineering, and the two are inseparable. Cheruiyot, Baack & Ferrer -Conill (2019) said that the practice and  role of nonprofit public institutions and civil technology, such as journalism, were essential for building society. Research conducted by Baack (2018) said something similar that it needed the terms between data journalism and civic tech that describe pr ogressive datafication in social life. Public aspirations that reflected in social media, the implications of data journalism are, therefore, increasingly strong to pay attention to the public interest.   Furthermore, meaningful work in journalism is data v alidation, both regarding parameters or indicators set according to journalism ethics and internal organization, including methods and results. Data journalism practices in Indonesia show that data validation is essential so that it must be present in ever y media. Quantitative statistical data are essential, but the visual artifacts must be balanced with the qualitative side. Related to this, Rinsdorf & Boers (2016) analyzed the occurrence of qualitative changes in newsgathering caused by the availability o f open data, big -data sources, and the consequences for quality management. Therefore, it is necessary to align and expand individual skills and inventory of new Table 2c.

	 77  resources. Likewise, the management of newsroom quality must be adjusted to provide accurate n ews in data journalism.   Big data in social media exists and grows in large numbers but must be structured according to needs. Ilham Junaidi, the editor in chief of the Republika  daily newspaper, said:   We often do not focus on social media trending topics because, in every editorial meeting in our newsroom, we discuss and debate about content planning following Republika's vision and mission. We still monitor the public aspirations or events that are being discussed by many netizens and use them to choose various alternative issues. However, we put forward Republika's mission as a national newspaper that wants to continue to bring a change towards a better direction with a new spirit.   Data Deepening and  Enrichment  The data deepening phase in data journalism is essential because it is at this stage that a balance is made between the work of computer machines and the narratives interpreted by humans, namely journalists. After a computer assists the work of a journalist with the results in the form of visual statistical data, illustrated images, and charts, then news craft and quality improvements are the lives of every journalistic work. All media in Indonesia operate with or without help visual statistic al illustrations in the written news series. However, every journalist at a time or periodically must combine the visual artifacts and verbal narratives of the news.   In certain conditions, journalism data presentation often does not reveal much for a type  of investigative reporting. Therefore, the journalist has the function to dig deeper into what happens behind the visual presentation of quantitative statistical data. Journalists must believe that the quantification system has shortcomings that must be c omplemented by quality.   In-depth interviews and confirmations in the check and re -check series are needed to avoid publication and broadcast errors. Journalists know who is eligible to be re -interviewed and confirmed for the interim results obtained. The snowball interview method, for example, is significant to be adopted to deepen the news side. Irna Gustiawati, editor in chief of Liputan6.com  online news explained:   We need to study and then determine the exciting side of the news to be discussed from jo urnalism data published by various institutions, consultants, or researchers. We Table 3.

	 78  consider all published data as a trending topic because we must pay attention to many aspects to create a booming issue for netizens. We consider the depth of data to be proce ssed and published gradually and its continuity. This performance depends on the public and viral response obtained from sharing links through social media. The involvement of netizens is significant to us.   All media samples in this research have a refer ence to achieve performance optimization. This achievement indicates that the media is growing with qualitative as well as quantitative measures. Journalists work with orders that are internally and externally outlined in the association of print press, television, and radio journalists.   On the one hand, journalism data writing practices are often considered narrative dry or lacking in life. Therefore, the data model makes it possible to juxtapose knowledge with writing narratives that are driven by events. Caswell &Dörr (2018) found several technical and editorial challenges. Two components, such as a structured database and narrative, are ne eded to provide journalistic knowledge to the writing platform from simple descriptions to real stories. So, the integration of quantitative artifact data and qualitative narratives is a way to achieve performance optimization. Lewis, Zamith&Hermida (2013)  also emphasized that analyzing big -data content requires an approach to computational and manual methods because an extensive collection of communication data challenges the traditional, human -driven approach to content analysis.   Model Development of Dat a-driven Journalism  The following development model of data -driven journalism process is a summary of all the steps taken to prepare data journalism. The experience is not only among media institutions in Indonesia but also throughout the world, and there fore this model is expected to be an essential practical guide for developing data -driven journalism in various places and times. The stages presented begin with the process of big data analytics and continue with the process of data journalism for the sak e of reporting, transparency, and democratic growth.   The six stages in this model are infrastructure data building, data structuring, data deepening and enrichment, data visualization, classification, clustering and composing, and finally, presentation an d publishing. At each stage, newsroom must perform tasks for both journalist and researcher, or specific as big data research team. This model can still be developed according to the conditions of each media, but overall it has been built based on experien ce stakeholders in Indonesia to practice and develop data -driven journalism.

	 79  Resource Policy and Management  Data journalism is a new way that places the ability and accuracy of computers to collect data and information to be processed, enriched, and prese nted on several media platforms. The length of the process makes it impossible for a journalist to do everything on his/her own. Therefore, we need organizations that pay attention to the new direction of journalism data. Editors -in-chief must learn quickl y, identify technical and policy issues for medium to long term development for media institutions.In terms of technical issues, Wu, Tandoc Jr. & Salmon (2019) saw the importance of technology companies that support media institutions to transform from tra ditional conceptions to data journalism. Furthermore, social media is now the foundation of citizens to participate in building democracy. Interaction of communication and reportage as citizen journalism enables citizens to transform the society, and accor ding to Pain & Chen (2019) from the results of their research in India, this is a form of participatory monitoring and evaluation.   One aspect that needs attention is the policy and management of resources, including human capital in the field of media institutions. Parasie (2015) argues that the efforts of news organization resources are needed to generate valid trust because data processing artifacts constitute a significant component of the big new data editorial space environment. According to Parasie ( 2015), even the use of this artifact, for journalists, must follow two opposite paths to produce reliable news, namely the "hypothesis -driven" path and the "data -driven" pathway. Along with that, Heravi (2019) also paid attention to the human capital of da ta journalism, which was considered weak in interdisciplinary insight.   Experience in forging data journalism allows each journalist to become proficient and in -depth in knowledge quickly. The quality of works that continues to improve is a good benchmark.  In journalism data, the quality of the work and presentation is understood as the result of better, faster, and more open data access. According to Hammond (2017), in the context of big data, human subjectivity tends to be downgraded, and that is an impor tant issue. However, the increase in 'datafication' is not what drives change in the profession but is a continuation of the preexisting, shaped by the broader context of contemporary conditions.   Media institutions must also continue to innovate, have inf luence, and solve the constraints as stated by Hewett (2017, the technical capabilities and knowledge of human resources in the world of journalism must adopt data journalism. The complexity associated with the demands of data journalism is very urgent and  must be able to identify critical problems and play a role in information technology. Usman Kansong, Media Group News Director in charge of MetroTV  and Media Indonesia , said:   At Media Group, we pride ourselves on being national and regional media with di verse cultures that are brought to the life of our organizations. We pay close attention to human capital policy and management as the main aspects of the operational and strategic media institutions. Many Metro TV and Media Indonesia alumni were successfu l, and they were promoted in various similar companies. We are proud to be very concerned about the continuous improvement of the ability of journalists, especially in data journalism.   As a comparison, one of the researches conducted in the United States was conducted by Fink & Anderson (2015) on beyond the "usual suspects" with the finding that there was a great variety of educational backgrounds, skills, tools, and goals among data journalists. However, many of them faced similar struggles, such as tryin g to define their roles in their organizations and manage scarce resources. Borges -Rey (2016) discussed data journalism practices in the UK with semi -structured interviews with data journalists, data editors, and news managers working for the UK mainstream  media
	. Innovation is needed to be synergistic with data journalism to storytelling, news, and news dissemination. Journalist resources are significant, and some of the large groups of journalists must focus as data -journalists as Wright & Doyle (2019) concern, who investigated how and why data journalism had developed in Australia. 
	 80  Research, through semi -structured interviews with journalists, led them to suggest that there should be a core group of data journalists in media institutions. Previously, from research in the UK, Knight (2015) found that the skills of journalists following computer technology were still considered low. The findings of Borges -Rey (2016) showed that most professional journalists demonstrated a degree of doubt about numbers and com putational literacy. There are demands of an industry that is growing with technology, which must also be followed by human competencies.   Appelgren, Lindén& Van Dalen (2019) also paid attention to the future of cross -continent data journalism resources. By comparing data journalism in Africa, Arabic, Italy, England, and Argentina, they concluded that three important contextual factors shape data journalism throughout the world, namely journalistic culture, media markets, and the political environment. In the future, the wave of post -cellular technology referred to as the progress of the vector of virtual reality (VR) by Hassan (2020) creates an 'empathy machine' that will form the basis of new journalism as used by the New York Times and the United Nations .  Finally, the collaboration between media institutions and citizens takes place, especially when news organizations struggle in difficult economic times. Konieczna (2020) calls a community collaboration with the term Stepladder Collaboration, namely "sim ple sharing, collaboration on stories, collaborating on methods, organizing events, allocating money, and working to solve a problem in the community."   CONCLUSION  Big data as a basis for compiling news and articles is an inevitable source in the online digital era. Data is continuously growing in various cloud computing centers from all walks of life. Journalists in the media and even citizen journalists must be able to analyze big data to be presented in data -driven journalism mode. Several steps must be taken to process large amounts of unstructured data into structured data to be validated, combined with qualitative aspects. The crafting steps of credible news or articles are trusted and used as a reference by the public, government, or related communiti es. The results of this research showed that big data analytics was conducted for data -driven journalism at national and local media in Indonesia. The data -driven journalism was routinely used in the production process and presentation. Data journalism is applied to online and conventional media, both in national and local media scopes in various regions. However, the knowledge and understanding of big data analytics for data -driven journalism were still inadequate in the newsroom and research supporter div ision. Several media in Indonesia apply data journalism by taking data from outside media institutions and are still lacking in qualitative enrichment. Journalists need understanding, knowledge, and skills to produce visual quantification so that journalis m data has a future in an increasingly competitive market. Ordinary people as new media participants also have not apprehended journalism data but only practice doing it to share information and entertainment.  This study suggests the model development of the data -driven journalism process from Indonesia's experience, which can be a guide for journalists. The managerial implication is that the newsrooms must empower the data -driven journalists' team and research division at media institutions.  Due to the ob servation and content analysis that was limited on media series document samples, future research on this topic could be performed with ethnographic methods in various media institutions, including in the process and interaction in the newsroom.

Lexicon -based sentiment analysis has been done to explore frequently used terms on the Tweets and Time -series plots have been generated to determine the flow of user sentiments. T -Test for Two -Sample Assuming Unequal Variance has been used to identify the significance of the sentiment type for eac h Bank. Results have indicated unique insights about the customer behavior like ―Significance of Sentiments on Engagement‖, ―Pattern of Tweeting and Timings‖, ―Impact of Bank‘s activities on sentiments‖. This study suggests ways to handle negative Tweets a nd emphasizes on the need for media monitoring tools for the timely discovery of Tweets. The study also fills multiple gaps by exploring the behavior of customer‘s negative sentiments, the impact of grievances in creating and sharing eWOM, and Twitter use behavior.   Keywords : Customer Service, India, Banks, Twitter, Social Media .  INTRODUCTION  Customer Service Management (CSM)  is a business process that primarily deals with the servicing of existing customers. With an increase in market competition, CSM has emerged as an important part of the organization's overall strategy. Christopher et al. (1991) have called customer service , a part of marketing strategy while Meltzer (2001) has claimed that organizations can boost profits by up to 100% just by retaining 5% of their most valuable customers which can be achieved through excellent customer service management. Efficient customer  service leads to enhanced customer satisfaction which in turn can generate higher revenue for the organizations. Researchers like (Ahmad and Kamal, 2002), (Cronin and Taylor, 1992), in their respective studies, have emphasized that service quality is the antecedent to satisfaction. Satisfied customers turn loyal customers for an organization and positively impact others Hoyer et al. (2001).   A study done by Nwulu and Nwokah (2018) has revealed that customer service management directly impacts sales growth , market share, and profitability of an organization. Businesses are now more customer -centric than product -centric hence prioritizing relations with customers can boost profits and revenue for the organizations (Soltani et al., 2018). Innovations and new technologies have brought new capabilities to the service organizations (Breidbach et al., 2018). Service provider‘s ―Behavior‖ and ―Attitude‖ are vital for the long term retention of the customers (Afshar et al., 2019).    Social media holds great potentia l for brands to come closer to the customers and further increase revenue, reduce cost, and improve efficiencies (Baird and Parasnis, 2011). Gavval and Ravi (2020) have mentioned that social media has become consumer preference to express thoughts and comp laints with regards to their product and service experiences while Tripathi (2019) has emphasized that social 
	 85  media help the brands to reach to the new customers. Users are rapidly turning to social media to request and receive customer service (Xu et al.,  2017). Social media helps in generating pro -consumer experiences (Dwivedi et al., 2019) and works as a forum for companies to manage their social relationships with customers (Hidayanti et al., 2018). Unlike traditional media channels, social media equips , enables, empowers & engages its user (Bhattacharyya and Roy, 2016). The growth of digital platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and others has attracted many brands and marketers to include them as part of their marketing mix. These channels help marketers to connect with buyers/ consumers and to interact with them. In an organization service requests made by customers, who adopted online medium to raise their concerns, have outnumbered customers, who use offline mode (Maecker et al., 2016). Accord ing to Wakefield and Wakefield (2018) poor brand experience leads to negative eWOM.   Like other social networking platforms, Twitter has witnessed multi -fold growth. The large set of data on Twitter is a vital source of information that carries user sentim ent and opinions on various topics (Hu et al., 2013).Retweets are considered to be the highest indicator of engagement (Leek et al., 2019).   Launched in 2006, Twitter enables its users to post/send brief messages called ―Tweets‖. character limitation for a single Tweet was previously 140 but in the year 2017, it was doubled to 280 characters (Rosen and Ihara, 2017). Here users follow other users‘ ―Handles‖ (or profiles), ―Retweet‖ (Share the Tweets of other users), ―Like‖ a Tweet, and can ―Comment / Reply‖  on a Tweet. Tweets and retweets are considered to be the online equivalent of word -of-mouth (WOM) communications (Gruen et al., 2006)   In a span of around 13 years Twitter has seen some great adaptations in terms of the number of users, usability, and gro wth (Bary, 2020) and as a result, had drawn attention from the research community to explore more insights about this platform. A few years back researchers have even studied the nature of this platform i.e. whether it‘s a Social Network or a News Media (K wak et al., 2010). Today, Twitter is not just used by individuals but also by Governments, Policy Makers, Influencers, Celebrities, Artists, Sportspersons, Businesses, Social Organizations, Think Tanks, Armed Forces, and many other institutional level user s. Owing to the profile of its users, Twitter is considered more serious compared to other networking platforms hence lands authenticity and validity if Tweet originates from reliable Handles. In 2013, a fake Tweet from the official Handle of US -based News  Agency Associated Press (AP) that claimed injuries to President Obama in an alleged explosion in the White House had caused the dropping of Dow Jones Industrial Average by 143.5 points and Standard and Poor's 500 Index lost more than $136 billion.   Twitte r has registered 11.7 million mobile app downloads on the App Store in the first quarter of 2019 with 330 million monthly active users. Around 500 million Tweets are sent each day and users spent 3.39 minutes on an average each day. The majority of B2B businesses (approximately 67%) are already using Twitter as a digital marketing tool while 75% of B2B businesses market on Twitter (Lin, 2020). 85% of Small and Medium Business (SMB) Twitter users say providing customer service on the platform is important.   Despite Twitter possessing great potential for active customer service management, several organizations in India including Banks are still employing traditional methods to handle customer grievances /concerns. These traditional methods sometimes result in  customer dissatisfaction as their concerns are overlooked by the Banks thus forcing them to post negative comments on social media platforms. Hence, it was observed to figure out the kind of information customers share about the Banks and their reaction o n social media w
	.r.t. grievances/concerns. This will portray their behavior on any of the social networking sites.   Considering the dearth of literature on customer service management by Banks through Twitter the following research questions need attention.   RQ1: What is the numbers and sentiments of Tweets that have been posted for each Bank and which sentiment type has drawn more user engagement ?  
	 86   RQ2: What is the flow of positive and negative Tweets daily and the top three positive and negative  terms used for each Bank?  RQ3: What is the user behavior for negative Tweets for the Banks and timings for overall Tweets and negative Tweets?   To address the said research questions, the following objectives have been framed which then have been tested e mpirically. The process has been explained in the latter part of the study.   RO1: To identify the volume of Tweets for each bank and their sentiment type.  RO2: To identify the significance of sentiment type on the user engagement  RO3: To identify the spill  of positive and negative Tweets daily.  RO4: To identify three positive and negative terms mostly used for each Bank.on user Tweets  RO5: To identify the pattern of users‘ negative Tweets for the Banks.  RO6: To identify patten of Tweet Timings   The remaini ng study is structured as follows. In Section 2, an extensive review of the literature has been discussed. Section 3 focuses on the methodology adopted for the study. Section 4 portrays the findings and provides a detailed interpretation of the same. The l ast section concludes the study by discussing the theoretical contribution, managerial implications, and limitations of the study followed by highlighting the directions for future research.   LITERATURE REVIEW  Customer Service  Goofin and Price (1996) have urged that customer service is significant because it helps in boosting product quality, gaining competitive advantage and profits thus increasing overall sales and income. A study by Mishra (2007) has underlined that customer satisfaction is an asset for organizations that can further help in building a sustainable long -term relationship with the customers. In a study related to the hospitality Industry, Parasuraman et al., (1991) have talked about customer expectations of service and highlighted that cust omer desires for more personalized and closer relationships with the service providers. Service responsiveness is an important quality indicator of customer satisfaction (Felix, 2017).   Customer Service Management in Banks  Service quality is related to hig her revenues and customer retention (Bennett and Higgins, 1988), and Banks should use service quality to beat the market competition. Chaoprasert and Elsey (2004) have argued that Banks should use service quality to beat the market competition. Another stu dy has highlighted that Bank marketers should aim for customer satisfaction. Uppal (2010) has studied the nature, extent, and mitigation of customer complaints in Banks where the emphasis was given on the need for dedicated customer care departments along with new methods and strategies to address customer complaints. Bhaskar (2004) in his study has concluded that customer service is the foundation for business expansion and the survival of Banking business is dependent on customer service. Customer service  should not be a proactive exercise and Bank marketers should focus on answering customer questions proactively to ensure pleasant banking experience (Paul et al., 2016). Efficient customer service management positively impacts customer choice for Bank (Ko chukalam et al., 2018).   Twitter as a Social Networking Platform  Growth in adoption and usage of Twitter by different segments of users has attracted eyeballs from many Researchers and Academicians. Many scholarly works have been done in the past to uncove r the use of Twitter in a different scenario. A few prominent studies are mentioned below.   By analyzing users‘ sentiments on Twitter for a service, areas of customer satisfaction/ dissatisfaction can be identified (Misopoulos et al., 2014). The dual nature of Twitter as a one-to-one and one -to-many communication channel can be leveraged efficiently to promote the business as well as to address customer complaints where the main business or corporate account can be used for brand promotion / strategic announcements while a secondary account can be used to address customer grievances (Burton and Soboleva, 2011)
	. A study titled ―Twitter Power: Tweets as Electronic Word of Mouth‖ (Jansen et al., 2009) has revealed that Twitter can be used to build a brand relationship with the customers 
	 87  and as a competitive intelligence platform. The real-time character of Twitter differentiates it from other social networking platforms and hence can be used for the on -time tracking of natural hazards like an earthquake (Sa kaki et al., 2010). Kwak et al (2010) in their study has called Twitter an information -sharing platform instead of a social networking platform. Organizations can improve customer relationships by listening to and addressing specific customer complaints on  Twitter (Ma et al/, 2015). The User Generated Content (UGC) on Twitter holds immense business value (Liu et al., 2017). Alwagait and Shahzad (2014) in their study experimented and concluded that timings play an important role in the impact of the Tweets. Ahsan et al. (2019) have argued that due to fast and broad delivery of Tweets as well as the absence of any content pre -check mechanism, Twitter has also been used to spread false information as well as rumors to create favorable sentiments, hence it is es sential to devise methods to timely detect the tweets.   Sentiment Analysis on Twitter  According to a research study done by Thelwall et al., (2011), the objective of sentiment analysis/opinion mining is to predict the behavior of the users, to evaluate the impact of big events, to discover a trend/pattern and to track public opinion on various issues. Twitter can be considered an ideal platform for sentiment analysis as it provides information on users‘ behavior w.r.t their opinions and experiences hence re veals a lot of insights about users‘ sentiments (positive, neutral, or negative) for a topic. According to Pak and Paroubek (2010), microblogging sites like Twitter is a rich source of data for sentiment analysis/opinion mining due to their diversified use r base. Savage (2011) has observed that Tweets at the individual level might not provide deep insights but collectively they can mirror the opinion of a larger group. Stock market mood prediction (Bollen et al., 2011), Predicting Elections through Twitter (Tumasjan et al., 2010) are notable work done in Twitter sentiment analysis amongst others.   Twitter as a Customer Service Management Platform   To register complaints, social media channels are quite relevant as they allow wide exposure to it and rapid esc alation (Stauss and Seidel, 2019). The outcome of a survey done by Twitter in the UK has revealed that 61% of people admitted that the public nature of the platform makes it an ideal place to talk about service queries with the brands (Picazo, 2016). Busin esses can draw benefits through Twitter by interacting with their audiences (Taecharungroj, 2017).   The popularity of Twitter among businesses is just not restricted to the promotion of products and services but also as a service platform to address custom er issues by interacting with them on a real -time basis. In 2009, American Consumer Electronic Retailer BestBuy Co instituted Twelpforce (@twelpforce) a team of 3,000 employees to respond to customer queries and to address complaints on Twitter (Wauters, 2 009) which was later transformed into a dedicated online community. Huang (2015) has highlighted that every month millions of interactions related to customer service are happening on Twitter. Several Twitter advertisers have mentioned that around 80% of t otal customer service requests come through Twitter.   Cairns (2016) in his blog post on Twitter has mentioned that when airline customers register complaints on Twitter and customers receives timely response; they‘re willing to pay on an average $9 more f or their next purchase from that airline‖. Twitter as a platform also empowers businesses to manage their customer service using a series of customer service -based features like Displaying support hours so the complainants know when they can expect a respo nse, Direct Messaging or DM, this feature is to handle complex issues or exchange of sensitive information privately, Call to Action (CTA) button on Tweets which allows the customer to send a direct message to the business, Welcome Message to initiate a fr iendly conversation (Alton, n
	.d.)   Companies that invest in customer service on Twitter have managed to resolve issues on one-sixth cost as compared to that of the call centers with a 95% resolution rate and 90% customer satisfaction rate (Masri et al., 20 15). Several organizations have embraced Twitter as one of the efficient channels to communicate with customers and other stakeholders (Malhotra and Malhotra, 2016).  
	 88  From a Bank marketing pe rspective, customer behavior analysis on Twitter can provide information on customer grievances, concerns, and other issues which can help Bank marketers to improve the service quality. This study is based on Five Indian Private Commercial Banks (Foreign P rivate Banks operating in India has been excluded). These Banks are, HDFC Bank (―HDFC‖) which was incorporated in August 1994. Forbes magazine has ranked HDFC at the top of its first -ever list of India‘s Best Banks 2019 on customer service and technologica l advancement. ICICI Bank (―ICICI‖)  has formally started its Banking operations in 1998. ICICI was the 1st Bank in India and amongst few global Banks to launch a service allowing cross -border remittances over social media. On the customer service front, I CICI Bank was the 1st Indian Bank to launch a dedicated customer service Twitter Handle in 2009 (@ICICI_Care). In the year 2015, ICICI became the first Bank in Asia to introduce money transfer services on Twitter. It has also launched India‘s 1st ―Social Customer Care‖ service in an exclusive tie -up with Twitter to offer advanced care to its customers (Chaturvedi, 2016). Third Bank in our list is Axis Bank (―AXIS‖) which was incorporated in the year 1993 and is one of the largest private Banks in the countr y in terms of total assets. Next Bank on the list is YES Bank (―YES‖) which began its commercial Banking operations in May 2004. In 2017, the Bank was awarded the ―Bank of the Year - India‖ award from The Banker magazine. Last Bank in the list is Kotak Mah indra Bank (―KMB‖). KMB was launched in February 2003. In a study by Brand Finance Banking 500, published in February 2014 by Banker magazine, KMB was ranked 245th among the world's top 500 Banks with a brand valuation of around half a billion dollars ($48 1 million) and a brand rating of AA+.   Theoretical Underpinning  There are multiple theories on customer behavior and the majority of them talk about ―dissatisfaction‖ and its determinants. But, ―complaint‖ is the consequence of ―dissatisfaction‖ hence the theory of Consumer Complaining Behaviour (CCB) is found to be the most relevant and is used in this study as a theoretical framework.  This theory has been resorted to explaining the behavior of consumers through their Tweets. As stated by Halstead (2002) feeling of dissatisfaction triggers consumer complaint behavior, so consumer complaining behavior is one of the prominently studied phenomena. Day and Landon (1977) taxonomy of consumer complaint behavior has been widely accepted theory and has been mentio ned by several authors in their respective studies. In this taxonomy, consumers have been divided into two broad categories, one, those who will ―take some action‖ and others, those who will ―take no action‖ (refer Figure 1). Action taken can be either pub lic (complaint to provider, third -party or legal complaint) or private (negative word of mouth, a personal boycott of provider) while ―no action‖ is about neglecting or ignoring. The ―action taking‖ consumer set whether public or private, constitutes the b ase for our study. From the perspective of this study, customer dissatisfaction occurs when service  Figure 1: A Taxonomy of Consumer Complaint (Day and Landon)

Selection of Banks  The Five Banksthat have been considered for the study are shortlisted based on the number of followers (refer Table 1) on the Bank‘s official corporate Twitter Handles.Interestingly, total asset wise same set of Five Banks top the list (data assessed by business portal Moneycontrol.com through Bombay St ock Exchange as shown in Table 2).

Initially using qualitative data analysis, Tweets were identified then quantitative methods have been used to analyze the Tweets. Systematic sampling techniques have been used to extract the data from Twitter. The sampling element of the study includes the top five commercial private Banks and the Tweets for these banks were considered as a sampling unit.   Study Duration  The study is based on the public Twitter data of the Banks for 06 months‘  duration(21 December 2018 – 21 June 2019).    Data Collection  The historical Tweets were acquired through a Twitter application programming interface (API) in the batch size of a maximum of 20,000 Tweets per report using individual Boolean search query for each Bank. The logic behind each query was to retrieve data that is relevant to each Bank while avoiding the Tweets which are meant for sister/group companies of the Banks or meant for products not directly offered by the Banks or Tweets that are authored by the Banks themselves. Table 3 shows the Bank name and number o f Tweets for each of the Bank considered for the study.   Table 3: Number of Public Tweets for each Bank.

First, the stopwords (such as in, an, is the, of, etc.), the words that are not relevant in conducting lexicon -based sentim ent analysis were removed from the text data of the Tweets. Next, the top words, in terms of the frequency, were generated for each of the Banks over the entire duration of the data timeline used in this research. Further, it was also found out that what a re the words that contributed most to the negative sentiment, and the words that contributed most to the positive sentiment. A time series plot was also generated for the negative sentiments and positive sentiments, for all the Banks for the entire data ti meline. T -Test for Two -Sample Assuming Unequal Variance was used to find if any significant 
	 91  difference was done for all the Banks combined to get a holistic view followed by each Bank individually. The value of alpha has been considered as 0.05 and the nul l hypothesis was set as 0 (two -tailed test) i.e. there is no significant difference between the mean of two data series.   RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  Numbers and sentiments of Tweets posted for each Bank and sentiment type with higher user engagement  Based on the analysis, the following results have been obtained (refer Table 7) with shows the number of Tweets and their sentiment type for the five banks that have been considered.   The above data shows that overall, the Five Banks have received more Tweets with ―Neutral‖ tone or sentiment followed by negative and positive Tweets respectively. At the Bank level, ICICI has received the highest number of overall Tweets while KMB is at the lowest end but at the same time, KMB has received the highest % of Tweets with  negative tone among all the 05 Banks. YES is the recipient of the highest % of positive Tweets.   To identify sentiment type that draws more user engagement,T -Test for Two -Sample Assuming Unequal Variance is used considering Tweets with positive and negati ve sentiments. First, the test is done for all the Banks combined to get a holistic view followed by each Bank individually. The value of alpha is considered as 0.05 and null hypothesis as 0 i.e. there is no significant difference between the mean of two d ata series.   For all the Banks combined, the output P -value is minutely smaller i.e. 0.049 than stated mentioned P -value of 0.05 which rejects the null hypothesis that there is no significant difference between the mean of positive and negative Tweets (as shown on above Table 8). Further mean value of the engagement of negative Tweets is 1.722 while for positive Tweets it is 1.443. This shows that negative Tweets carry more user engagement than positive ones.

YES  The value of output P -value is smaller i.e 0.0001 than the mentioned P -value of 0.05 which rejects the null hypothesis (as shown in Table 13). For YES, the mean of Tweets with negative sentiments is 2.508 which is much higher than that of the mean of positive Tweets i.e. 1.680.

This shows that a  large number of negative Tweets for ICICI at the end of January 2019 came amid termination of its CEO (Mukherjee, 2019) while another spike was seen around mid-February when users started complaining against one of its employees (Telanganatoday, 2019). Ri se in negative Tweets for HDFC in June 2019 is probably since HDFC Mutual Fund declared investing in the Non -Convertible Debentures (NCDs) of cash strapped Essel Group (Borate, 2019). Figure 5 shows the flow of positive Tweets for the Banks.  The trend of t he tweets shows the spike on positive Tweets for ICICI in February which came after a celebrity featured product ad got high user engagement.For HDFC, rise in positive Tweets came after the news about the Banks‘decision to support the restoration of 20 cyc lone -affected schools in the state of Odisha (Pande, 2019)   Identification of the Top 03 positive and negative terms used for each Bank   AXIS  The analysis of the Tweet has revealed that for AXIS the top three negative terms are ―atrocity‖, ―conspiracy‖ and ―problem‖ while ―support‖, ―refund‖ and ―work‖ are the top three positive terms used frequently for the Bank.   A similar analysis for the other four banks has also been done. For HDFC ―harassment‖, ‗issue‘ and ―compliant‖ are the frequently used negati ve terms whereas ―good‖,  Figure 3: Flow of Positive Tweets    Figure 4: Popular positive and negative terms for AXIS   
	 95  ―cashback‖ and ―support‖ are the top negative terms used. In the case of ICICI, frequently negative terms used are ―fraud‖, ―cheating‖ and ―scam‖  while positive terms ―free‖, ―benefits‖ and ―support‖ are mostly used terms ―worst‖,  ―issue‖ and ―fraud‖ are mostly used for KMB on negative Tweets while on the positive graph ―successful‖, ―prosperous‖ and ―contribution‖ are the top terms mentioned by its users. Lastly, for YES, top three negative terms used on the Tweets are ―loss‖, ―ba d‖ and ―issue‖ while ―great‖, ―good‖ and ―support‖ are the top positive terms.   4.3. Description of user behaviour for negative Tweets for the Banks and timings for overall and negative Tweets   Tweets with negative sentiments have been analyzed to evaluate  the Tweeting pattern (refer below Table 14).   Based on the analysis as shown in Table 14, it has been concluded that, On KMB Tweets, 5391 Tweets have been marked to Bank Chairman Uday Kotak along with other Handles while in 3168 Tweets (25.86% of total negative Tweets) only the Chairman has been marke d. YES doesn‘t have dedicated Handle for customer support and encourage its customers to register complaints via emails. HDFC has dedicated official Handles for Home Loan New Customers, Home Loan Current Customer support, Education Loan customers, and Bank  News. 2597 Tweets contain the mention of Home Loan New Customers and Home Loan Current Customer support Handles, 1454 have also mentioned Bank News Handle and 78 Tweets contain Education loan Handle mention.

	 96  Further graphical representation of the number of overall Tweets and negative Tweets per hour, has been done for all the Banks combined and then for  the individual Banks to find out the pattern of Tweets timings.   Figure 5 reveals that ICICI has received the highest number of overall Tweets between 17.00 – 17.59 hours while the period 11.00 -11.59 is the peak negative hour for the Bank (Figure 6).

	 100  Theoretical Implications  The study is the first attempt in its kind to analyze customer behavior on Twitter for private sector Banks in India. Contrary to similar studies don e in the past for other scenarios where analysis has been done on the limited number of Tweets or data obtained through surveys, findings of this study are based on a large number of Tweets (for a time duration of 06 months). Hence, study results reflect a  broader perspective.  In past, few studies have analyzed how user sentiments on Twitter can be used to predict the activities on real -world like mood of \ stock market, political opinion, etc. but on the contrary, this study has given a sense on how real-world business activities can also impact customer sentiments on Twitter which may lead to a larger online discussion around the brand.   Managerial Implications  The findings of this study hold great significance for the Banks' marketers about the use of Twi tter as an effective medium for customer service management. Study results confirm that Bank customers are actively using Twitter to connect with their respective Banks and to share their grievances with other Twitter users. Results have revealed that it i s extremely important to address negative Tweets as negative sentiments dominate over positive sentiments thus represent bias for negativity on Twitter (Nisar et al., 2018). Quick personalized responses, taking the conversation offline with the customers o r conversations via Direct Messaging (DM) on Twitter to keep them ―non -public‖, requesting customers to either delete the negative Tweet/s or Tweet positive acknowledgment, once the grievances are satisfactorily addressed / issue is resolved; are some of t he ways to address them.   The study has also presented insights about timings of Tweets for each of the Banks which can further be used to strategize manpower planning and crucial support hours which supports the findings that the timely resolution of cust omer complaints makes them loyal customers (Tajuddin et al., 2020)   Word cloud drawn for positive and negative Tweets for the Banks can be used to identify customer satisfaction and service improvement area  Considering the behavior of the Tweets, Banks ca n plan grievance tracking tools to discover unmarked Tweets. Also, a large number of Tweets have been only marked to Bank‘s primary/corporate Handles and to the top management (to Chairman only in the case of KMB) which represents multiple scenarios viz Cu stomer‘s unawareness for the presence of dedicated support Handle, Lack of confidence on support Handle‘s resolutions, Longer turn around time on the resolution by support Handle, customer‘s behavior of issue escalation to the Bank‘s top management. Bank m arketers can plan customer surveys/feedback to determine the reasons for such behavior to take corrective measures.   LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE SCOPE OF WORK  This study has not examined the relationship between the number of Tweets ―impressions‖ vis a vis Tweet sentiments which is an important factor from customer service management and marketing perspective. Also, researchers can investigate if real -world activities can scientifically predict users‘sentiments on Twitter   CONCLUSION  For Banks, Twitter is primarily a customer service management platform than an information -sharing platform. Sentiment analysis of Tweets is a vital source of information related to customer behavior which can be used to make business -related decisions. Timely detection of Twee ts is also extremely important to control the spread of negative discussion around the brand. The study has also highlighted that business activity in the real world impact user sentiments on Twitter hence in the event of a crisis or unpopular business dev elopments , Bank marketers can expect the enhanced flow of negative sentiments on Twitter.

Searching Twitter with the key word ―perubahaniklim‖ returned 4542 individual tweets in the six -month period from March to October 2019. This study took a quantitative approach to observe Twitt er users contributing to the climate change discourse. By analyzing the frequency distribution of tweets, we analyze Indonesian Twitter accounts based on the number of followers, the number of tweets, and the distribution of tweets. We categorize contribut ors to the Indonesian climate change discourse onbyinfluencer size (mega, macro, micro, and nano -influencer). The study found that influencer size effectsin climate change discourse on Twitter. The effect is more strongly correlated to the distribution of tweets than the number of tweets.This study provides new insights for future climate change communicationthat combines interpersonal communication, mass communication, journalism development, and new communication media, especially social media.   Keywords: Climate Change, Social Media, Influencer, Twitter, Discourse   Introduction  A Paradigm shift in communication has occurred in the new millennium era. The digital revolution is creating information and communication renaissance, which is more vibrant than ever, offering faster and cheaper communication access, fewer barriers to ent ry and more information to consume (Chatterjee, 2016). Meanwhile, climate change has now also become an attention in Indonesia. Public discourses in climate change have also spread in the digital ecosystem in Indonesia. According to the search index using Google trend within the past year by finding information based on "perubahaniklim"  (climate change in English) keyword, people who accessed and searched information about climate change in Indonesia increased from March 2019 to March 2020 (see Figure 1).   According to (Cody et al., 2015), 'many to many' communication changes the way of journalists or environmental scientists in informing the climate change. Instead of a single journalist or scientist telling the public what happens, social media offers a Figure 1. Search for keywords of climate change in the past year     
	 106  mechanism for many people from various backgrounds to communicate and form their own opinions about climate change so that public discourse can be productive. Exposure to social media can potentially turn climate change problems into public discourse (Boykof f, 2011; Cody et al., 2015; Dearing, James W, 1996). Social media utilization to obtain information about public discourse has increased, especially in modern research nowadays (Lineman et al., 2015).   According to Kemp (2019), Twitter is the sixth most a ccessed social media (52 percent) in Indonesia. As a microblogging platform, Twitter provides a platform for verbal expressions and emotional responses (Lineman et al., 2015; Signorini et al., 2011). In Sharma &Goyal (2018), Twitter is mentioned as a power ful communication tool because of its utilization as a social networking platform. Twitter is used to circulate fact, information, idea, or thought that is known as a tweet. In contrast, Fuchs (2014) has mentioned that Twitter is not categorized as a commu nication tool instead of mostly information media as it is very limited to public discourse. Nowadays, a tweet is restricted to 280 characters in most languages (Sharma &Goyal, 2018). Cody et al. (2015) argued that the limited length of tweets means that t weets represent the thinking -doing -feeling of the community in the digital ecosystem.   In social media, as well as Twitter, we also know about an influencer who is trustworthy spokespeople. Mediated communication model through a trustworthy spokesperson will also be a vital component in climate change communication shortly (Priest, 2016).  Social media influencers represent the third party forming specific behavior of the audience through their blog, tweet, and other social media channels (Freberg et al.,  2011). The concept of influencer on Twitter more or less refers to opinion leaders in the Two -Step Flow Theory within the scope of social media (Wu et al., 2011; Baran, 2013).  Many researchers have tried to measure influence on Twitter. Cha et al., (2010)  described indegree influence which was the number of followers of a user, directly indicating the size of the audience for that user; retweet influence, which was the number of retweets containing one's name, indicating the ability of that user to generat e content with pass -along value; and mention influence, which was the number of mentions containing one's name, indicating the ability of that user to engage others in a conversation. Kwak et al. (2010) compared the number of followers, PageRank, and the n umber of retweets. Meanwhile, Weng et al. (2010) compared the number of followers and PageRank with a modified PageRank measure, which accounted for a topic.   There is a literature gap in observing influencers on Twitter in terms of the number of followers . Some researchers believe that a fundamental principle emphasizes on social media user with a large number of followers representing a higher level of influence on social media platforms (Li, 2018). Other researchers stated that the number of followers wa s not necessarily related to his/her influence (Cha et al., 2010; Kwak et al., 2010; and Weng., 2010). This premise mostly relates to the number of followers not directly generating retweet or mention. This paper will highlight the gap by focusing on the n umber of followers' influence on Indonesian Twitter in climate change discourse contributed by influencers in various sizes (mega, macro, micro, and nano), who mostly rely on the number of followers. This study will answer the question if the influencer si ze on Twitter has an influence on climate change discourse.   Importance of the study  Twitter plays an essential role in public discourse about politics. Twitter has gained its global popularity because it is used in the American election campaign in 2016 t o provoke political campaign support (Sharma &Goyal, 2018)
	. Twitter message examines information that stimulates audiences to follow, retweet, and recite narrative descriptions. Political personalities cause command considerable authority because of the re peated devolution of Twitter narratives (Cook et al., 2014).   According to Evans et al. (2018) in Leal Filho et al., (2018), Social media, like Twitter, is the right vehicle for sharing and exchanging information in communicating climate change in order to  stimulate global, regional, national and local -scale change. Through social media, climate change communication can cope with geographic obstacles and actualize interaction convergence between communities, both 
	 107  physically and virtually. Unfortunately, research in climate change discourse in social media, especially Twitter, is scarce in Indonesia.   Jang & Hart (2015) said that climate change communication research focusing on framing issues in some literature was very limited to analyze the natural framing  of issues in people's daily interpersonal conversations, which can be conducted through social media research, like Twitter. In modern research, new media provides an alternative way to transcend limitations in existing research by analyzing social media content. By using an analysis machine, modern research can analyze online conversation that is generated and shared by the audience (Brossard &Scheufele, 2013; Jang & Hart, 2015). This research variation enables the flexibility of the approach and helps sc holar notice what occurs in public on Twitter about climate change so that the result can be utilized to formulate responses of public discourse in climate change and be useful for practitioners in creating powerful climate change communication.   Theoretic al Framework  Twitter and Climate Change Communication  According to Evans et al. (2018), effective communication about climate change must include the participation of the audience to promote inclusivity and fairness in discussion and decision making. Trend s in climate change communication research have focused on the role of media, and journalists include scientists and science experts, business elites, politicians, and civil society representatives as sources when they create stories and news coverage abou t climate change. In this context, the general public becomes the passive recipients of the news. This leads to a climate change communication process is dominated by journalists, scientists, politicians, and other organizations whose views are already fra med in the context of global climate change. As a result, framed perception and understanding occurred in public, especially those who had limited and low levels of knowledge. They caused less deliberate action towards the emerging issue of climate change in their area (Evans, 2015). Therefore, according to Evans et al. (2018), communicating climate change needs a hybrid model that can build a bottom -up and bottom -down communication process. A hybrid model might be developed through social media in the wide r climate change communication process.   Information and Communication Technology (ICT) plays an essential role in supporting the development and social change. Although social media is not  a large -scale impact on making social change, the small impact resulted in digital initiatives in social media can create greener lifestyle p
	 108  Twitter offers  a new research opportunity to capture conversations in the network that naturally occur in everyday life (Jang & Hart, 2015; Kwak et al., 2010).   In previous studies, Twitter became the research object. Jang & Hart (2015) utilized Twitter data to observe social media user trends in America, especially in states where Republican was the dominant party. They used 'global warming' terminology to mention climate change. Lineman et al. (2015) revealed the differences in the sentiment within the population betwe en those who used 'climate change' and 'global warming' terminology. Meanwhile, Cody et al. (2015) explored much information from Twitter about climate change. There are many ways to express their concern about climate change, starting from book launching,  idea contestation, to public figures who discuss climate change. The use of specific terms or information and 'who' delivers the information on Twitter can raise the sentiment in the climate change issue. By using the analysis machine, we can search for data on Twitter through a particular keyword. This machine will look for suitable data that are relevant to the keyword. The machine will also determine the frequency, but it does not reveal popularity. The relation between frequency and popularity lies in the search volume during a specific duration. By identifying a particular number of searches in a certain period, we can get direct comprehension regarding what are the popular terms within the population (Lineman et al., 2015).   Measuring Influencer Size Effect on Twitter  Interpersonal communication overgrows through the social network that not only one person can talk to another, but also much information is revealed and becomes more influential in the internet era like today. In general, influencers in s ocial media are often associated as someone, mostly celebrities, who have power and influence. Unfortunately, this definition contains an ambiguous meaning. Everyone is an influencer. They could be some experts, some ordinary people, journalists, or even s emi-public figure like media representative, and government officials who communicated the same way, through a tweet and to their followers (Bakshy et al., 2011). This study does not discuss whether an influencer is an individual or a group of people. Infl uencers in this study are social media influencers that could be anyone, any media outlet, organization, or celebrities (as known as celeb tweet), depend on the number of followers.   The industry offers more clarity about influencer classification, whilst academic literature lacks consistent about specific definitions of what constitutes a large number of followers of an influencer. In Kay et al. (2020), there are several influencers classifications, such as two -level influencers (micro and macro) and three -level influencers (micro, macro, and celebrity). Thomas (2017) in Kay et al. (2020) argues that determining social media influencers by their number of followers is easily adapted to focus on the number of likes influencers receive as well as through the percentage of followers that like posts.   Twitter influencers in this study are in the context of marketing practice, which can be categorized based on the number of followers. The first category is mega -influencers, which are the influencers whose followe rs are more than 1 million. The second category is macro -influencers, whose followers are between 100,000 to 1 million. The third category is micro -influencers, whose followers are between 1,000 to 100,000. The fourth category is nano -influencers, whose fo llowers are less than 1,000 (Firmansyah, 2019).   To discuss the influencer size effect, we must refer to previous research conducted by Cha et al. (2010). One of the Twitter influences is in degree, the number of followers of users who directly shows influ encer size. Indegree only represents user popularity
	. However, it is not related to other essential things, such as influence and audience views. This conclusion is based on Twitter users who have a high indegree (the number of followers) are not necessari ly influential in terms of spawning retweet or mention.   In contrast, Baskhy et al. (2011) said that although the content was not found to improve predictive performance, it remains the case that individual -level attributes in particular past local influen ce and number of followers can be used to predict the average future influence. A new class of semi -public individuals like bloggers, authors, journalists, 
	 109  and subject matter experts has come to occupy an important niche on Twitter, in some cases becoming more prominent (at least in terms of the number of followers) than traditional public figures such as entertainers and elected officials (Wu et al., 2011). Another research highlights that micro and macro -influencers impact differently on purchasing intent ion while disclosing or not disclosing sponsorship (Kay et al., 2020). It means that the number of followers does affect audience engagement. From the previous studies, the hypothesis of this study is given below:   H0. There is no influencer size effect in  climate change discourse on Twitter.  H1.  There is an influencer size effect in climate change discourse on Twitter.   Methods  This study combines collecting tweets and quantitative research methods. Tweets from influencers consist of the number of tweets and the distribution of tweets. In this study, we call them tweet frequency distribution. Neuman (2010) defines frequency distribution as a table that shows the distribution of variables in a category of some instances/information. The variables can be nom inal, ordinal, interval, or ratio level data.  There were 4542 tweets from Indonesian users by searching keyword "perubahaniklim"  through an analysis machine called Socialert from March to October 2019. Socialert provides the details, including reach, menti ons, and replies of each tweet. By collecting tweets frequency distribution, we have data variables about influencers based on the number of followers, the number of tweets, and the distribution of tweets.   Meanwhile, the most important thing in quantitati ve research is dealing with data. Quantitative research can use generated data from surveys, content analysis, or experiments (Neuman, 2011). In this study, we use collected tweets from Socialert as a data source to do quantitative analysis. However, the challenge is to combine, to analyze, and to conclude them. One of the essential steps is tweet coding.   Referring to Neuman (2011), the coding procedure is a set of rules created by the researcher for assigning numbers in specific variable attributes, usual ly in preparation for statistical analysis. The coding procedure explains how we convert non -numerical information into numbers to be a codebook. In this case, the codebook is the document that explains the coding variable derived from collected tweets. Af ter that, we continue the coding process by entering data in which one of their methods is a code sheet. We collect the information, then transferred it from the source onto a grid format (code sheet).   TweetsCoding  There were only 1540 tweets, and 818 Twitter accounts from 4542 tweets can be a data source. We excluded tweets from Malaysian and Singaporean accounts even though they are in the Malay language. For the next step, we coded the data manually. In doing so, the content contained in the tweets w as categorized by the climate change mitigation sectors in Indonesia. Mitigation is an attempt to reduce greenhouse gasses (GHG) and carbon emissions that contribute to climate change (Zhao et al., 2018). According to the Knowledge Center of Climate Change  Indonesia (2019), the Indonesian government divides the mitigation actions into five sectors, such as forestry, agriculture, waste management, industry, and energy. In addition, this study adds a general category for tweets that cannot fit into the catego ry.  Furthermore, we categorized influencers size by grouping them based on the number of followers as mega -influencers (more than 1 million followers), macro -influencers (followers are between 100,000 to 1 million), micro -influencers (followers are betwee n 1,000 to 100,000), and nano -influencers (followers are less than 1,000). After that, we classified the frequency distribution of 1540 tweets coming from influencers into six climate change topics (general, forestry, agriculture, waste management, industr y, and energy)
	.   Statistical Test  The next stage of this study is to test statistics using SPSS software. The statistical test looks at the relationship between influencer size and tweets about climate change in six predefined topics. As the assumption of data normality is not fulfilled, this study uses a non -parametric Kruskall Wallis test. Through the statistical test, this study looks at whether there is a difference in climate change discourse in terms 
	 110  of influencer size with the following statistical hypotheses:  H0: there is no difference in climate change discourse in terms of influencer size  H1: there is a difference in climate change discourse in terms of influencer size   We decide to accept H0 if p -value> 0.05, which means there is no influencer size effect because climate change discourse is not different in terms of mega, macro, micro, and nano -influencer and reject H0 if p -value <0.05, which means there is influencer size effect because climate change discourse is different in terms of mega, ma cro, micro, and nano.   Results  According to Lineman et al. (2015), data search on Twitter can be done using specific keywords. The result of these keywords produces relevant data from the keywords. From the tweet coding based on the search results of Socia lert, we can figure out the influencer size in climate change discourse on Twitter, as shown in Figure 2 below:   Figure 2. Influencer size in climate change discourse on Twitter   Climate change discourse on Twitter was dominated by nano -influencer from March – October 2019 (see Figure 2). The highest number of influencers in sequence werenano -influencers 490 accounts, micro -influencers 270 accounts, macro -influencers 43 accounts, and mega -influencers 15 accounts. Based on the data, we can define that discourses occurred centered on a general level that only discussed defini tion or phenomenon, less about mitigation action in Indonesia (see Figure 3).   Figure 3. Climate change discourse in mitigation topics on Twitter     The Kruskal Wallis test revealsa difference between mega -influencer, macro -influencer, and nano -influencer  in climate change discourse. The difference in overallis statistically significant ( p value < 0.05) (see Table 1). As a result, the hypothetic decision rejects H0, which means a significant difference in climate change discourse in terms of influencer size .   From the result, we confirm that there is an influencer size effect in climate change discourse. This result criticizes the previous studies, which stated the number of followers is not necessarily influential (Cha et al., 2010). The result may not be able to directly state that influencer size effects audience engagement to generate retweet and mention; however, the influencer size does affect climate change 0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%Mega-InfluencerMacro-InfluencerMicro-InfluencerNano-Influencer0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%80%90%ForestryAgricultureWaste ManagementIndustryEnergyGeneralTable 1 : The mean difference between influencers based on the number of followers   N Mean Rank  Test Statisticsa,b Climate Change Discourse  Nano -Influencer  490 352,04  Chi-Square  133.955  Micro -Influencer  270 470,85  df 3 Macro -Influencer  43 618,48  Asymp.

Discussion  How influencer size effects on climate change discourse is when influencers (from nano to mega -influencer) contribute different tweets frequency distribution about climate change topics, such as the number of  tweets and the distribution of tweets. Mega and macro -influencer results in the highest mean rank in climate change tweets amongst other influencers. Micro -influencer result in lower mean rank than macro and mega. Meanwhile, nano -influencer results in the  lowest mean rank (see Table 1).    For further detail, we describe the mean rank based on the topics of climate change mitigation, as shown in Table 2, as follows:  As shown in Table 2 above, some interesting facts can be mentioned. Mega -influencer is the influencer who has the highest mean rankabout forestry topics, agriculture topics, and general topics. Meanwhile, macro -influencer is the influencer who has the highest mean rank about waste topics, industry topics, and energy topics. On the other hand, na no-influencer is the one who has the lowestmean rankcompared with the other influencer size in any topic.  Furthermore, we can find that mega -influencer has 69 tweets of 15 accounts, macro -influencer has 149 tweets of 43 accounts, micro -influencer Table 2.

Frequency distribution in climate change tweets by influencers     
	 112  has 585 t weets of 270 accounts, and micro -influencer has 737 tweets of 490 accounts. These numbers are interesting research findings. Nano and micro -influencer have a large number of tweets and accounts, but lower mean rank than mega and macro -influencer whilst the  distribution of tweets of mega and macro -influencer more spread out in various topics of climate change than nano and micro -influencer (See Figure 4).   To concludewhich one is more correlated with the effect of influencer sizein climate change discourse, we conducteda correlation test. The Kendall Tau b test shows that influencer size has a significant, positive correlation, and fair agreement with the number of tweets ( τb = 0.364, p-value < 0.01) andthe distribution of tweets ( τb = 0.400, p-value < 0.01). H owever, influencer size is more strongly correlated to the distribution of tweets than the number of tweets. It means the distribution of tweets gives more effect of influencer size in climate change discourse.   In social media, such as Twitter, content fr om users about climate change can grow. The impact of this proliferation of user content is the emergence of opinion leaders formingnano, micro, macro, and mega -influencers (Anderson et al., 2014; Lee, 2012; Metzger et al., 2010; Walther and Jang, 2012). However, who are the influencers in mega and macro size? Mega and macro -influencers in this study consist of three dominant parties, namely the media, non -profit / community, and celebrity (see Figure 5).   As shown in Figure 5, media remains a dominant play er in the consumptive element of social media and as an important factor in shaping public views about climate change (Gladston& Wing, 2019). With the presence of media in social media, the role of media is multiplied.Not only does media act as an informan t about climate change, but it alsoplays a role as social media influencersthat has a significant impact on climate change discourse. In the future, gatekeepingroles regarding climate change issues possiblyweakened, while media role as influencers strength ens up becauseof shifted audience tendency from passive to active information -seekers through new media (Priest, 2016, h 95 -117).   Besides the media, non -profit organization/ community and celeb tweet are also part of macro or mega -influencer in climate change discourse(see Table 3). The top ten most -followed users onTwitter are not corporations or media organizations, butindividual p eople, mostly celebrities. Ordinary users onTwitter are receiving their information from many thousands of distinct sources, most of which are not traditionalmedia organizations. Only about 15% of tweetsreceived by ordinary users are received directly from  the media (Wu et al., 2011).   Table 3 : Macro and Mega Influencers on Indonesian Twitter  Rank  Top Influencer in Climate Change Discourse  1 Media  2 Non -Profit/Community  3 Celeb tweet  4 Government  5 Private company  6 Educational institution   In this case, non -elite media or users outside the media organization grow their content that Figure 5 : Influencers in mega and macro size    
	 113  can influence public views. As an opinion leader on Twitter grows, the media no longer monopolizes information related to climate change (Anderson et al., 2014; Lee, 2012; Metzger et al., 2010; Walther  & Jang, 2012) .  According to Evans et al. (2018), in the future, communication for climate change needs to have an integrated approach that combines communication and interpersonal, mass communication, journalism development, and new communication media, especially social media. The purpose of integration between these different models of communication is to create participative communication for continuous social changes. The direction of scientific communications, as climate change communications are shifting from previously sees individuals as information distribution of climate change into communication that emphasizes on public discussion and pushes social changes (Priest, 2016).   The implication of the Study  This study result will be useful for  academic and practice purposes. The existence of non -elite media or users outside the media organization who grow their content in social media will impact to climate change communication. Media is not the only source to get climate change information. Th e future climate change communication combines interpersonal communication and mass communication in social media. As the climate change issue will be widespread through social media, environmentalists have to consider two -step flow information in communic ating climate change, which involves influencers in social media. In Indonesia, climate change communication could be influential through macro and mega influencers such as media, non -profit organizations/communities, government, a private company, and edu cational institutions.   Conclusions  In this study, we observed influencers in climate change discourse on Indonesian Twitter. From the study, we know that nano -influencers dominate Twitter with a general topic in climate change discourse. In particular, from the research finding, we can also conclude that there is an influencer size effect in climate change discourse. How influencer size effects climate change discourse is when influencers contribute their tweet frequency distribution about climate change . From the statistical test result, mega and macro -influencer are the highest mean rank because of their tweets about climate change. The mega and macro -influencers in climate change discourse on Indonesian Twitter are media, non -profit organizations/commu nities, government, a private company, and educational institutions.   Media no longer monopolizes the distribution of information since non -elite media or users outside the media organization grow their content that can influence public views through socia l media. However, media remains a dominant player, an important factor in shaping public views about climate change. With the presence of media in social media, the role of media is now multiplied. Media acts as information gatekeeper about climate change;  on the other hand, it also plays a role as social media influencers that has a significant impact on climate change discourse.   Limitation of the Study  Though we have resulted in finding in the research, this study still has some limitations. We know that  the influencer size effects on climate change discourse on Indonesian Twitter. However, this study is lack of observing what effect coming from influencer size. The research finding may not be able to state that influencer size effects on audience engagem ent to generate retweet and mention. Moreover, all generated data from Socialert were only a tweet frequency distribution that correlates to only one keyword based on search volume for six months. As a result, not every tweet population is reliable to be analyzed, so that we need to reduce the data.  The statistical test was also conducted as a non-parametric test because the distribution of data was not normal
	. Another limitation is the data coding based on climate change mitigation, yet including climate change adaptation.   These limitations can be a recommendation for future research about climate change communication utilizing big data as their sources. The research can set longer time range data as well as using a parametric statistical test. Beyond all  the research limitations, this study can be an input to a communication professional to create their 
	 114  strategy when communicating climate change in the future, especially in utilizing influencers based on their size effectively. New media can be the backbo ne of climate change communication research ahead.   REFERENCES  Anderson, A. A., Brossard, D., Scheufele, D. A., Xenos, M. A., & Ladwig, P. (2014).

Visual data or infographics enable readers to understand and comprehend complex information effortlessly. In an era of technological development, consumption of information is faster and quicker, and so the storytelling potential of data visualisation narratives is productive. During a global endemic like coronavirus, the mounting fear motivates people to seek accurate and credible information swifter and also change health beha viour accordingly. This paper tries to explore the representation of visualisation of data during the outbreak of global pandemic – COVID -19 for three months – from 1 January to 21 March 2020 in two leading national newspapers – The Hindu and The Times of India. The study identified the percentage of coverage, different levels and types of infographics and message characteristics of infographics. The study found that response and self -efficacy related infographics were primarily less in number compared to s everity and vulnerability. Media  needs to adorn a robe of ‗ social responsibility ‘ especially during a global pandemic like coronavirus, which is sweeping across the globe – as visual message tend to have more impact than the text.  Keywords: Content Analysis, Coronavirus, COVID -19, EPPM, Infographic   INTRODUCTION  Infographics – Readers‘ delight! Skimming through daily newspapers and magazines, or scrolling social networking sites, we come across ‗pictorials filled with information‘ – the new age transmission of information – Infographics, which tries to inform, simplify, delight and motivate a reader. Today, individuals live in a faster and complex world, and they prefer to s ee and receive information in a more précis and intelligent manner. Data visualisation attempt to communicate multipart information in a manner that can be consumed and understood easily . (Smiciklas, 2012).   Infographics are widely used because ― they can rapidly grab attention, simplify complex concepts and connect components of complex concepts ‖. (Damman, Vonk, van den Haak, van Hooijdonk, & Timmermans, 2018) They obtain the power because they tap into the very powerful (but at times eccentric) human visua l information -processing system.  (Kosslyn, 1985) As cited in (Otten, Cheng, & Drewnowski, 2015), a human brain process visuals faster than text, i.e. nearly 50% of the brain is into processing visuals  - human brain can sense visually in less than one -tenth of a second.  Infographics bring out the hidden stories in numbers and figures, and also a broad -spectrum of information is communicated efficiently and effectively. Further, it processes multiple and enormous information through variations, thus deliveri ng risk -bound information quicker in a limited space. (Dur, et al., 2014); (Dur, 2012)   Today, an infographic is an additional tool to elaborate on the information present in the news story (Salas, 2018) and provide a pictorial representation of ‗big‘ events (Castaneda, 2018). The study found that there is a steady rise in the use of infographics in newspapers or interactive infographics by using set templates (Gazizov & Fatykhova, 2019). Infographics coupled with health -related information can bring in  a change in behaviour. Health communication aims to bring positive behaviour in an individual for combating health concerns.  (Bhattacharyya & Roy, 2016)   This paper explored the storytelling potential of an infographic from health concern (a risk communi cation perspective) – levels, types
	 
	 117 and the proportion of infographic coverage given, and understanding the message characteristics of infographics.   REVIEW OF LITERATURE  A Panorama of Infographics  Infographic‘s chronological viewpoint provides a peek into  infographic as an effective tool in various sectors.  As early as the 1600s, infographics began with the use of maps. Christopher Scheiner, in 1626, using his pantograph published sunspots, is considered as the first infographics. In the later years, in 1789, William Playfair published ― Commercial and Political Atlas ‖, which contained bar and pie charts. By 1800s, visualisation was widely used in government offices for statistical information representations, which included bubbles and 3D charts, and conto ur plots. In 1858, Florence Nightingale‘s infographic on causes of mortality in the British army facilitated in convincing the Queen to provide better health care facilities.   Similarly, in 1859, John Snow published an infographic, which portrayed the outb reak of cholera and convinced many on the spread of cholera. In 1869, Charles Minard‘s cartographical representation of Napolean‘s Russian campaign in 1812 paved the way for the extensive usage of infographics. Furthermore, by the beginning of the 19th century, we have seen a rapid growth of infographics. By 1900s, infographics were widely used in scientific and niche groups and later, by 1930s, media outlets slowly and gradually adopted it.   Infographics and Journalism  Since the 1980s, graphics were used t o support the works of journalism. Usage of graphics crept into the newsroom during the 1970s and 1990s, when Peter Sullivan used graphics or visual reporting in the Sunday Times and subsequently, the USA Today newspaper, in 1982 launched – ‗SnapShots‘, a column specifically for graphical representation of statistics. Edward Tufte often referred to as Leonard DaVinci of infographics, raced the newsrooms with infographics. By 2000s, infographic witnessed a boom in the newsrooms. Since 2009, there has been a rise in the use of the term ‗infographic‘ to describe visualisations that use various graphics to display data and other ideas.   (Ferreira, 2014)   The newspaper provides an avenue for enhancing the coverage by adding graphic along with the text, which bri ngs in perspectives and depth to the news story. Further, graphics have become part of the news package, wherein statistics coupled with artistic design provide a story to its readers. (Giardina & Medina, 2013)It was found that 42.4% of the newspapers run more than six infographics on an average weekday, while 43.7% of the newspapers publish more than six infographics on an average Sunday.  (Utt & Pasternak, 2000) .  Infographic is found to satisfy both the needs of the editorial department of the organisatio n and also aids in a better understanding of the content for the readers. In today‘s newspaper, infographics rule the rooster – in terms of design and content. Infographics are often seen as a replacement of photographs, thus adding colour and attraction t o the page. Studies suggest that infographics attract the readers to the particular article while in the case of a dominant infographic; a little more than half of the readers used it to springboard into the article (Pasternak & Utt, 1990)   Readers tend to  read and examine graphics before reading the text, and bigger graphic draw the readers to the story and also enables to highlight fewer important details. (Pasternak & Utt, 1990); (Hollander, 1994);  (Dur, et al., 2014); (Siricharoen, 2013)   Some research suggests that graphic devices allow readers to easily grasp a description of an event by making some details more prominent. (Miller & Barnett, 2010) found that graphics with text enhance the attention as well as be beneficial to the readers.   The role of a newspaper graphic designer is known to create a graphic based on what is known and how to communicate it
	.  (Cairo, 2006) Most graphic designs pertain to using bars and lines, initially. However, in the recent times, illustrations, iconic re presentations and drawings have taken precedence.  (Meyer, 2009); (Cairo, 2006) Information related to sales growth and fall, the incidence of illness, do‘s, and don‘ts, travel itinerary, medal tally are represented visually for easy understandability.  (F ew, 2017)   
	 118 In the field of medicine, data visualisations were being used as early as the 1850s to create visual arguments based on data. In 1858, Florence Nightingale used medical data to create a coxcomb chart, which revealed the significant difference be tween the numbers of soldiers dying due to sanitary conditions versus battlefield wounds during the Crimean War (Brigham, 2016);(McCrorie, Donnelly, & McGlade, 2016). These infographics are intended to translate complex health -care information into simplif ied graphical snapshots that will leave the readers with a better understanding of how a disease can occur, be treated, and possibly even be prevented. (Balkac & Ergun, 2018)   For risk communication in a crisis like coronavirus pandemic, it is essential to  communicate clearly, precisely as well as accurately to the target audience. Visual designers place the risk in ‗context and perspective‘ to provide an understanding of the risks involved. In times of crisis, people hover with many questions – What, Who, Why, How? It is during this time, data coupled with the right tool will enable readers to see patterns and trends, which is sometimes invisible. During health outbreaks, it is crucial to disseminate the credible and reliable message, as false information c reates an environment of ‗infodemic‘.   Types of infographics  Infographics may take various shapes and contours, but the three main categories are: data graphics, maps, and diagrams whichcan be either static (for print or screen use), animated or interactiv e (for screen use) (Otten, Cheng, & Drewnowski, 2015), while some studies categorise infographics as data visualisation or statistical (tables, lists, lines and bar charts), informational design or timeline or chronology  (timelines, chronology, flowcharts, comparisons, hierarchical and anatomical illustrations), process infographics  (a linear process of a topic) and editorial  (icons and symbols) (Siricharoen, 2013). Albers (2015) in his study highlights four -types of infographics: simple information graphic – bullet list, and snapshot with graphic needs, and complex information graphic - flat information with graphic needs, and information flow/process.   In the field of healthcare, according to (McCrorie, Donnelly, & McGlad e, 2016) there are four infographics: isotype array  which uses similar icons or symbols; polar area diagram  or coxcomb graph , a representation of pie and bar charts; word cloud , (hub and spokes) a cluster of words (spokes) arranged hierarchically according  to prominence, size, colour around a hub (a central word); and charticle  uses attractive colours, texts, graphs and charts to break out complex information and make it more understandable for a common man.   Infographics and Communicating Risks  Communicati ng vital information, especially during an outbreak of pandemic disease, is always a challenge. During such a situation media adorns in shaping public opinion and perception of risks. (Welhausen, 2015)  In the field of health, visual representation of emerg ent public outbreaks aid in ‗improving attitudes and risk perception‘  (LaCour, Beyer, Finck, Miller, & Davis, 2019). A common stratagem for risk dissemination to common people (non -experts), is through maps, bar and line graphs. Further, effective usage o f colours plays a significant role in ―communicating risk, improving comprehension, and increasing confidence in interpretation‖.  (Turchioe, et al., 2019)   Researches indicate that layman understand risks better when presented in visuals  (Ancker, Senathirajah, Kukafka, & Starren, 2006); (Lipkus & Hollands, 1999), as they fear that they have limited control over the threat as well as fear being hazardous to them and their loved ones (Welhausen, 2015). Consequently, taking cues from the var ious fields of psychology, usability, graphic design, and statistics, infographic aims to reduce barriers such as limited time and information overload to understand necessary information, (Otten, Cheng, & Drewnowski, 2015)  also, it persuades people for an  attitude and behavioural change
	.  (Bice, 2019) However, ―less attention has focused on how these visuals shape risk perception, particularly in crisis and emergency risk communication scenarios, which frequently involve culturally divergent audiences.‖  ( Welhausen, 2015)   THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK  The risk communication primarily focuses on ‗fear‘ – which trigger individual to engage in health behavioural change. The extended 
	 119 parallel process model (EPPM), a culmination of other risk and fear appeal theories a nd models highlights on perceived threat (involving perceived severity and susceptibility - appraisal of the threat), which motivates self -efficacy (appraisal of efficacy) among individuals. In other words, as risk increases individuals are motivated to eng age in self -efficacy and response efficacy. (Lapinski, Neuberger, Grayson -Sneed, & Gore, 2019); (Witte, 1992); (Li, 2018);(Chen & Yang, 2019). The model provides a structure for understanding communicative health -related or risk messages effectively. (Malo ney, Lapinski, & Witte, 2011) Using EPPM constructs, the study explores how the effective usage of infographic is disseminating health -related information.   METHOD  Using a content analysis technique, the study collected infographics published in The Hindu and The Times of India from 1 January to 21 March 2020, till the day of announcement of ‗Janata curfew‘, which was the initial period of the virus outbreak. The study identified n=42 in The Hindu (TH) and n=143 in The Times of India (TOI) newspaper using a  consecutive sampling method. After employing inclusion and exclusion criteria, i.e. only infographics on COVID -19 health -based, n=36 and n=97 were identified in TH and TOI.   The selected infographic was categorised based on date, size of the infographic, headline, the level and type of infographic. The study modified the parameters of (Ghode, 2013), (Shin, 2016), and (Welhausen, 2015) into Level 1,  which includes tables or bullet points, bar, pie or poll graph, line or fever -line, organisational or procedu ral flow chart; Level 2  includes themes or graphics or drawings such as conceptual diagrams, maps, typography, and symbolic interpretations and Level 3 , is a combination of level 1 and 2 coupled with illustrations, stylistic representation of information. Further, the usage of colour and collectivism (group) and individualism (individuals). Additionally, to understand the message characteristics – using Extended Parallel Process Model (EPPM) parameters – severity (the level of potential threats), vulnerabil ity (negative consequences by the risk), self -efficacy and response -efficacy (to avoid and prevent threat) was analysed. The objectives of the study include:  RQ1: To analyse the percentage of coverage for infographics  RQ2: To identify the type and level of  infographics  RQ3: To categorize the message characteristics of the infographics   ANALYSIS  The coverage of infographics in The Hindu and The Times of India found that The Times of India published more infographics in comparison to The Hindu.   Percentage of  Coverage  In The Hindu, the study had taken n=36 infographics for the analysis, which predominately focussed on COVID -19. The average editorial space of The Hindu during the selected dates is 67.79%, and out of this 1.31% is devoted to infographics. The Hindu had two individual infographics, seven infographics published in the column ‗ data point ‘ in opposite to editorial page (OpEd) and 27 infographics as part of the article (in -text infographics). ( Table 1 )  Table 1: Percentage of  coverage  The Hindu  Number of Infographic  Infographic Space (in cms)  Percentage % Data Point  7 1607.25   Infographic a 2 288  In-text Infographic b 27 4286.25    36 6182.5  1.31 The Times of India     Infographic a 72 7159   In-text Infographic b 25 9564.25    97 16751.25  1.97 a. Independent Infographic  b. Infographics with articles   In The Times of India, the study had taken n=97 infographics. The average editorial space of TOI during the selected dates is 64.41%, out of which 1.97% is devoted to infographics. The Times of India had 72 individual infographics and 25 infographics as part of the article (in -text infographics). ( Table 1 )  Level and Type of Infographics  The Hindu had used predominantly used level 1 infographic (n=21), i
	.e. table and bullet points infographic, followed by level 2  (n=12), i.e. theme -based and level 3  (n=3), i.e. usage of illustrations to convey the message. The 
	 120 colours used in the infographics – are mostly red, followed by grey, yello w, orange, teal, blue and violet. Most of the infographics were text-centred (n=29) rather than graphic -centred (n=7) ( Table 2 ). Similarly, TOI had also used level 1  infographic (n=49), followed by level 2  and 3 (n=25; 23). The colours used in the infograp hics – are mostly red, black and blue. Most of the infographics were text -centred (n=64) rather than graphic -centred (n=32) (Table 2 ). The Times of India had utilised more infographics to convey ‗risk‘ or ‗threat‘ to public effectually.   Frames  The news stories were analysed from a public health model of reporting approach, which  takes its roots from framing and agenda -setting theory. (Coleman & Perlmutter, 2005); (Coleman & Thorson, 2002)   According to Entman (1993 and 2004), the frame looks into the specific problem, establishes the cause of the problem, arrives at a judgement a nd suggests remedies for the issues. Public health model also tries to define risk, develop and evaluate methods to prevent problems in order to alter the public health conditions in the society. Keeping this approach, news stories with infographics on COV ID-19 were analysed from the perspective of the cause of the disease, risk factors and preventive strategies.  (Kang, Gearhart, & Bae, 2010).   The study found that in The Hindu, only one news story focussed on the cause of the disease – ―A window into nove l coronavirus transmission ‖, while the rest of the stories covered the risk factors, which primarily focussed on the number of deaths, high alert and lockdown areas, and mapping of contact and the preventive strategies that highlighted on ― Tackling COVID -19 at ground level ,‖ ―COVID -19: PM calls for social distancing, people‘s curfew ‖, and ― Quarantine facilities near airports soon, 24 -hr helplines set up ‖. Most of the news stories were thematic as it focussed on the larger group of people than individuals.  Meanwhile, in The Times of India, more news stories with infographics focussed on the risk factors and preventive measures rather than on the cause of the disease. The Times of India carried stories such as ― WHO says China virus now global emergency ‖, ― Coro navirus slows in China, but gallops across the globe ‖, ―Avoiding ice-creams may not save you from coronavirus, but washing hands will‖, ―Washing Hands is essential, but where is the soap for it? ‖ and ― Save lives with social distancing‖.   Message Characteristics  In terms of message characteristics, The Hindu focussed highly on the severity (n=22) of the coronavirus by providing numbers of COVID -19 cases reported in India and globally, followed by vulnerability (n=19), response -efficacy (n=13) and s elf-efficacy (n=11). The newspaper focussed exceedingly on severity rather than on response -efficacy and self -efficacy. During a time of crisis, it is essential to provide information on self -care management as well as community care, which will enable cit izens to prevent the spread of the disease. ( Table 2)   In severity and vulnerability, The Hindu principally focussed on the number of deaths, vulnerable population, namely people with hypertension, diabetes and other comorbidity and also referring to previ ous disease outbreaks such as SARS. The keywords used in the infographic headlines carried were ―closely related to SARS ‖, ―case count ‖, ―quick progression ‖, and ― rising cases ‖.  Table 2:Level, Type and message characteristics of infographic   The Hindu  TOI   The Hindu  TOI  Category  Count   Category  Count   Level 1  21 49 Severity  22 69 Level 2  12 25 Vulnerability  19 69 Level 3  3 23 Response -Efficacy  13 51    Self-Efficacy  11 46 Collectivism  17 59 Statistical Evidence  22 60 Individualism  19 39 Exemplar Evidence  17 55 Text -centred  29 64    Graphic -centred  7 32      
	 121 While, for response -efficacy and self -efficacy focussed on letting people kno w of traveling to affected areas such as ― fear of flying ‖ and ―No-fly zone ‖ and preventive measures such as washing hands frequently, wearing masks, measures to be followed while sneezing and coughing and maintaining social distancing and home quarantining .  Additionally, infographics headlines, which were carried along with the articles, tend to create fear and panic. The headlines such as ―In the grip of fear ‖, ―the spread of a deadly virus ‖, ―the global spread ‖, ― the virus that shook the world ‖, and ― viral count ‖ incline to generate fright in the reader‘s mind.   The newspaper had an infographic column – ‗Data Point ‘, in the OpEd page, to provide statistical information, which also carried headlines such as ― Spread of a deadly virus ‖, ―Anatomy of an out break ‖, ―Global emergency ‖, ―Testing Times ‖, Going viral in Europe ‖, ―No-fly zone‖, and ― Victim Profile ‖. These headlines depicted severity and vulnerability of the regions affected by coronavirus as well as created panic and uncertainty.   However,  ― Preve ntive measures ‖, and ― Good old soap‖ in the FAQ page of The Hindu newspaper highlight the precautionary measures and how soap can be used instead of sanitizers.   Relatively, The Times of India also focussed on severity and vulnerability (n=69) followed by response efficacy (n=51) and self -efficacy (n=46). Nonetheless, it should be noted that TOI focussed on preventive measures comparatively more than The Hindu. ( Table 2)  The severity and vulnerability infographics focussed on ― mass evacuation ‖, ― 1053 under scanner in State ‖, ―Major virus infection, fatality rises‖, ― How worried should you be about coronavirus ‖, ―Elders, kids advised to stay home‖, ―When age is a factor? ‖and  ―Heart Patients, Diabetes at Most Risk: WHO study‖. While, response -efficacy and self -efficacy focussed on ―How to reduce risk ‖, ―How and when to wash hands ‖, ― What we know and what we don't know ‖, and ― What if there is an infected person in city? ‖  Further, TOI had carried ― TN Covid Tracker ‖, ―Corona Tracker ‖, ― Mapping outbreak ‖, and ―Tracking outbreak ‖, on a daily -basis for informing about the number of deaths region -wise. However, the infographic was placed in a non -significant position in the newspaper.Most of TOI infographics predominately focused on risk factors – ―Battling Virus Spre ad‖, followed by preventive measures (n=34)  - ―Be Safe, Not Sorry ‖, ―To-do list‖, ―Don't shake hands, Do Namaste ‖, ―How and When to wash hands ‖, and ― Shore up your defence ‖ and cause of the disease (n=6) – ―Rallying to battle virus threat ‖, and ― How coron avirus hijacks your cells ‖.  Further, unlike The Hindu, the word – ‗COVID -19‘, which was represented in capital letters, The Times of India used the lower -upper case to represent the word. The headlines in the infographics generated a fighting chi – ―Fight  so far ‖, ―Battling Covid -19‖, ―Safety Net ‖, ―Testing times ‖.The Hindu and The Times of India infographics focussed on providing statistical evidence comparatively more than an exemplar shred of evidence. Infographics were keen on representing the number o f deaths and people infected, and countries affected rather than on response -efficacy and self -efficacy, which is the sole factor of ‗social or physical distancing‘ during the spread of coronavirus.   DISCUSSION  The infographics in The Hindu and The Times of India noticeably shape the perception of risk. Though both newspapers, focused on severity and vulnerability, comparatively The Times of India, focused more on response and self-efficacy.  Similarly, graphic -representation of data was predominantly high in TOI than in The Hindu. Graphics representation with the use of colour – red, metaphorically created anxiety and alarm. However, analysing interactive and animated infographic would have provided a perception of people‘s understanding of risk -based infor mation
	.   To summarise, as a common axiom says, ―A picture is worth a thousand words‖, a good infographic aid in processing information quickly by lowering barriers of complexity and also tell a story to its readers. They transform abstract data into appeal ing visuals for better understanding for a common man, and the power lies in the hands of a graphic designer. Though readers find infographics attractive but failed to promote message properly. (Hollander, 1994);  (Few, 2017); 
	 122 (Siricharoen, 2013 );  (Albers , 2015) ; (Bresciani & Eppler, 2015);  (Welhausen, 2015); (Andrade & Spinillo, 2016).   Further, as pointed out in the meta -analysis of fear appeals, fear stimuli have a direct or indirect effect on health behavioural changes.(Witte & Allen, 2000)Infographics  can radically change our perception of risk. The framing of the language, colour, headlines communicate a different message to the readers and at the same time,  graphics could easily persuade readers to disregard the article . Nevertheless, as Albert Cairo , journalist and information designer stated visual or graphics can lie and mislead people. It is essential to understand this pitfall and read and understand the graphics and move toward ‗ evidence -driven visual communicator ‘ and also be a responsible data  journalist in the time of a disease outbreak.   CONCLUSION  Risk communication is reiterated in EPPM and public health models, which stress on the fact that coverage of health -related information affects individual‘s risk perception i.e. threat, which propo rtionally motivates for health behaviour depending on the health concern. Therefore, it is essential that media outlets emphasis more on self -efficacy of citizens through pictorial representation of data especially during global contagion for bringing in p ositive health -related behavioural change.

S. Bhakar  Director , Prestige Institute of Management  Gwalior, MP, India   Dr. Shilpa Bhakar  Associate Professor , Prestige Institute of Management  Gwalior, MP, India   ABSTRACT   The study evaluates the effect of Price Promotion strategy (PPs), extensively used by online stores to promote sales and improve market share, on Brand Equity (BE) elements of these stores.  The study focuses on the mediating role played by the two promine nt elements of BE, perceived quality (PQ) and brand awareness(BA) in forming the relationship between the PPs on brand association (BAsso) and brand loyalty (BL) in case of online stores (Amazon, Flip Kart, Snap Deal).  The data for the study was collected  from the students of graduate and post graduate programs at Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh (India) selected on the basis of random sampling method. The causal relationships between PPs and the elements of BE along with moderating effects of PQ and BA on the rela tionships of PPs on BAsso. and BL were evaluated using SEM methodology. PPs contribute positively to all the four elements of BE (PQ, BA, BAsso. and BL). The study has thus, made significant contribution to the existing literature that unlike physical stor es, in case of online stores, PPs contribute in improving all the elements of BE instead of having adverse effect.  The study has made another very important contribution to existing literature in evaluating the mediating role played by PQ and BA. The resu lts indicate that PQ fully mediates the relationships of PPs with BAsso. and BL. Similarly, BA fully mediates the relationships of PPs with BAsso. and BL.  Keyw ords : Price Promotion, Brand Equity, Brand Awareness, Perceived Quality, Brand Association, Bran d Loyalty  INTRODUCTION  Brand equity is the overall value that the customers attach to a brand. Major contributors to research on branding have conceptualized brand equity on the basis of consumer perspective (Aaker, 1991, Keller, 1993 and Christodoulides et al. (2010) or on financial perspective (Sullivan, 1993 and Haigh, 1999). Proponents of Customer based brand equity have also differed in identifying the components of brand equity and the factors affecting brand equity. Majority customer based perspective identified BL, BA, BAsso and PQ (Aaker,  1991;  Yoo and Donthu, 2001;Konecnik and Gartner, 2007; Gill and Dawra, 2010). Some other researchers used additional constructs such as customer satisfaction (Kim et al. 2008), brand image (Keller, 1999), organizational associations (Sinha et al. 2008) brand trust and brand commitment (Marquardt, 2013) as components of BE. Research on factors affecting customer based brand equity have identified PP (Vidal and Ballester, 2005), brand attitude (Faircloth et al. 2001), brand ambassador credi bility (Dwivedi and Johnson, 2012), Event Marketing (Zarantonello and Schmitt, 2012) as predictors of BE.  Therefore, many business organizations invest a lot of money on marketing communication, such as price promotion (PP) with a hope of attaining high b rand equity (BE). PPs are most commonly used as to attract consumers and increase sales. Companies usually use PP‘s to stimulate sales, increase trials, attract budget conscious buyers, retain loyal customers, or provide increased value perception (Huff & Alden, 2000). However, the question is whether PP methods increase BE of a product. Raghubir & Corfman (1999) confirmed that PP‘s provide an economic incentive to customers in order to purchase a brand.   The studies evaluating effect of PPs on consumer br and evaluations can be placed in three groups
	. First group includes studies that 
	 125  have depicted positive effects of PP‘s on BE elements ( Kuehn & Rohloff, 1967; Cotton &Babb, 1978; Bawa & Shoemaker, 1987; Rothschild & Gaidis, 1981 and Lattin & Bucklin, 1989) . Studies in the second group  have shown negative effects of PP‘s on BE elements (Davis et al. , 1992; Ehrenberg et al. , 1994; Morais et al., 2006 ; Mullin & Cummins, 2008; Campo &  Yague, 2008) whereas the studies in the third group have identified insignificant or no effect of PPs on BE elements (Neslin and Shoemaker, 1989;Davis, Inman, and McAlister, 1992; Bravo, Andres & Salinas, 2007; Sriram et al., 2007 ).    Online retail store s use price promotions in a big way to increase sales and market share. In physical stores case, price promotions used extensively, may adversely affect their perceived quality and in turn brand loyalty. Does PP strategy affect PQ and BL in case of online stores also in the same way as it does in case of physical stores. Therefore, evaluating the effect of PP strategies on components of BE in case of online stores is vital. Thus, there is a need of an in depth study to evaluate the effect of PP on overall e quity of a brand and its elements,  BA, BL, PQ and Basso in online stores case. Current study evaluates the effect of PP strategies used by online stores (Flipkart, Amazon and Snapdeal) on their BA, PQ, BL and BAsso. Promotion efforts of companies lead to higher degree of knowledge of the brand (awareness and PQ) (Villarejo et. al., 2005) but the ultimate objective of these promotions is to increase their customer base and improve BE.  Accordingly, the current paper models the impact of PP on BL mediated by PQ and BA also the impact of PP on BAsso mediated by PQ and BA in case of online stores. The study will evaluate the following conceptual model:   Conceptual Model        LITERATURE REVIEW  PP - BE  The impact of PP on BE has been studied by various researcher but results are contradictory. Some researchers have confirmed negative impact (Jedidi et al., 1999; Yoo et al., 2000; Mullin & Cummins, 2008; Buil et. al., 2010; Selvakumar & Vikkraman, 2011). Ramos & Franco  (2005) studied the relationship in washing machine product category. They found that price incentives used for uplifting sales affect the established reference price levels and have negative impact on BE. The authors demonstrated a negative relationship b etween price deals and BE. From strategic perspective also price deals show negative effect as it diminishes BE (Yoo et al., 2000). If a product is over -promoted, consumers will buy less of the product at the regular price and wait for PPs. In other words,  PPs can reduce the consumer‘s reference price, which in turn results in lowered BE (Lattin & Bucklin, 1989; Mayhew & Winer, 1992). A stream of literature also shows that PPs can persuade consumers to postpone their purchase decision and wait for a lower p rice in the future ( Assunção & Meyer, 1993; Kalyanaram & Winer (1995); Mela et al. (1998) which will have negative effect on BE.   PP is found to have positive effect on BE (Vidal & Ballester, 2005; Chu and Keh, 2006; Melina and Evelyn, 2011). In tobacco industry information delivered to customers (related to a particular brand), through promotional methods is considered as an important variable that affect the equity of these brands positively (Marcel, 2009).  In Indonesian beverage industry ( Nurcahya, 20 14) found positive effect of PP programs on three elements of BE i.e. PQ, BL and BAsso. To have this positive effect on brand equity marketers must design creative promotional campaigns. It is not necessary that while using price promotion technique organi zations need to give ‗one on one‘, 50 % off, or pay less get more. Rather than providing on the spot financial benefit it is recommended that organizations should try out methods of price promotions which help in building long term relationships with the c ustomers such as coupon discount on next purchase, price discount to other customer recommended by the first one or a chance of winning a trip, etc
	. These types of PP techniques will keep the customers close to the brand for longer time PP BA PQ BL BAsso 
	 126  which in turn will increase BA, if satisfied, increasing BL and up lifting brand equity.   Some investigators found that the effect is statistically insignificant ( Ehrenberg, Hammond & Goodhardt, 1994; Sriram et al., 2007; Gil et al., 2007). Kuntner (2017) studied the effect  PP on different BE level brands. He distinguished brands on the basis of initial equity levels (like high, moderate and low initial equity brands). He concluded that for low-equity brands, PP strategies have close to zero effect, but for higher initial eq uity level brands the effect is highly negative. He also demonstrated that the negative influence of PPs on the brand‘s equity is proportionate to the increase in initial BE level. Thus, higher initial equity brands should avoid using PPs and low equity br ands can use PP deals to attract new customers, non -users, or competitor brand customers (Ardestani, et al., 2014) .  Review of literature explains that PP can affect BE positively as well as negatively, depending on product category, level of initial equity , brand positioning, target segment, etc. Thus, marketers must analyze all these factors before deciding to go for PP strategy.   PP - PQ PP strategy is used by organizations to attract non buyers, increase sales, increase market share and to attract custom ers of competitor brands. Buil et al., (2013) have explained that if PP strategy is introduced in the market in such a way that it is perceived as value for money by the customers then it could bring about a positive effect on brand evaluation. In contrast  it is also possible that customers perceive that products of inferior quality are promoted through PP thus price discounts may negatively affect consumers‘ quality perceptions (Rao & Monroe, 1989; Madan & Suri, 2001; Agarwal & Tea, 2002).   Various models  developed by researchers indicate that price -quality based strategies are a double edged sword. It can have both positive as well as negative effect on brands (Milgrom & Roberts, 1986; Jedidi et al., 1999; Ramos & Franco, 2005). The prevailing theory, which says that price can serve as a quality indicator, hinges on the consumers‘ belief that if something costs more, then it must be better. If organizations want to take advantage of this belief than they should set ―quality -assuring‖ price which should be a protection price for both organization and a value for money for the customers (Klein & Leftler, 1981). As if customers feel that a firm is trying to sell a product for less than the quality -assuring price, then it will lead to a low quality impression a bout the product (Bagwell & Riordan, 1991; Kirmani & Rao, 2000).   Given that informed consumers purchase from high -quality sellers and uninformed consumers purchase from both high - and low -quality sellers, the literature shows that uninformed consumers can get a price -quality reference point from the informed consumers (Chan & Leland, 1982; Cooper & Ross, 1984). In addition, previous studies have also provided evidence of a strong contribution of price in developing PQ (Dodds et al., 1991; Erdem et al., 2002; Ramos & Franco, 2005).   Huang  et al., (2014) studied the effect of PPs on customer‘s PQ and repeat purchase intentions. They predicted a positive impact of PPs on PQ and customers‘ repeat -purchase intentions. They also identified that gender and consumption frequency does not demonstr ate a moderating effect.   Vecchio et al., (2007) evaluated the long term effect of PPs on brands PQ. They found that in long run frequent use of PPs can have negative influence on brands PQ. This effect might not be significant after one PP but if repeated  several times it could change the consumer‘s reference point because products with lower price are considered to have poorer quality (Ophuis & Trijp, 1995; Alba et al., 1999). Villarejo & Sanchez, (2005) posited that PPs are perceived as short -term benefi ts by the consumer; they contribute to lower quality perceptions in the long -term
	.  In contrary Waanders (2013) evaluated the effect of deep PP‘s on store brand and high end brand of wheat bears and found out that deep PP‘s could also have a positive effect  on brand name and PQ. But to get that positive effect BA needs to be high. This research also explained that deep PP‘s positively influenced the taste experience of the high end brand but negatively influenced the taste experience of store brands. Therefo re, in the long run PPs could influence the PQ of the store brand negatively (Ophuis & Trijp, 1995). Based on 
	 127  the above evidence from the literature hypothesis 1 has been set up.   Hypothesis 1: PP contributes significantly to PQ PP - BA Researchers and orga nizations have continuously worked on to understand the effect of different promotional techniques on BA level of their brands in various industries so as to identify the most appropriate promotion package in order to achieve maximum BA of their respective  brands. Villarejo, et. al. (2005) evaluated the direct and indirect effect of the marketing strategies on BA. They indicated that the marketing efforts of the companies significantly increase brand awareness, and thus enhance the probability of brand recall at the  time of actual purchase. Piratheepan & Pushpanatha (2013) evaluated the effect of different promotional techniques (advertising, sales promotion, direct marketing, etc) on BA in milk powder industries. They found that all forms of marketing efforts have p ositive effects on BA, but in comparison to advertising and sales promotion the impact is less significant in case of personal selling and direct marketing. Thus, in milk powder industry sales promotion (PPs, coupons, etc) will help in increasing BA.   Gilb ert & Jackaria (2002) evaluated specifically the effect of ‗get one free unit on purchase of one unit‘ promotion techniques on BA. They concluded that this type of promotional technique may not affect BA before first time purchase, but once the customer ev aluates the product and finds the deal fair enough, it will enhance the chances of better brand recall for future purchases. Nurcahya (2014) also did not find any significant impact of PP on BA. Shelvakumar and Joshna found positive effect of PP on BA in c ase of Banking and no effect of PP on BA in case of fast food restaurants. Based on the above discussion of literature hypothesis 2 is framed.   Hypothesis 2: PP contributes significantly to BA PP - BL Earlier models depicted that consumers want to establis h loyalty towards a specific brand, but recent studies concluded that due to rise in literacy rates and easy access of information, customers have become choosier and evaluative in terms of value for money (Jing & Wen, 2008; Koçaş & Bohlmann, 2008). Thus, organizations can use promotional tactics including PPs to attract these evaluative customers and retain them through timely rewards (Raju et al. 1990; Rao 1991). Eisman, (1990)has also concluded that use of promotions helped organizations in stimulating t he purchase intention of customers and retaining customers through various incentives. Pressey & Matthews, (1998) have stated that the probability of a shopper to switch from normal brand to competitor brand increases by fifty percent if it is on promotion .  Price deals may motivate consumers to make purchase and if satisfied, then repeat purchases (Marcel, 2009), but here the loyalty is Pseudo -Loyalty because when the campaign is over, consumers interest in the brand decreases gradually. Nevertheless, PP encourages customers to try new products and if they are satisfied, it may lead to repurchase and a positive outlook towards the brand.   Anderson & Kumar (2007) identified that if organization is targeting price sensitive market then they should promote mo re often and deeper, as the price -sensitive segment gets positively affected by the level and repetition of the discount. While studying online books selling data Koçaş & Bohlmann (2008) revealed that the frequency of promoting weaker brands is low with hi gh discounts whereas for stronger brands this strategy doesn‘t work. For stronger brands frequent but smaller PP‘s result in higher degree of BL. In manufacturing industry also, weaker brands use promotions to retain their loyal customers, as a defensive s trategy whereas on the other hand stronger brands use promotions to attract loyal customers of the weaker brands (Raju et al., 1990).   It is widely accepted that PPs can enhance sales immediately, by stimulating consumer trials, some of whom might become repeat buyers (Ehrenberg et al
	. , 1994). Selvakumar and Joshna (2011) found significant effect of PPs on BL for Banking and fast food restaurant brands. Hendra and Budi (2017) and Chi Yeh and Yand (2019) also reported positive effect of PPs on BL. Based on the evaluation of the above literature hypothesis 3 is formulated.   Hypothesis 3:  PP contributes significantly to BL  
	 128  PP - BAsso  A brand‘s price is not only a financial tag associated with it. It is as much important as brand name, logo, packaging or endorser of the brand. Price of a product in comparison to competing products, moderate the Brand Image a customer has in mind. Thus, before introducing a PP strategy, marketers must analyze the influence PPs will have on their brand image and other Brand Associations and how strong this influence will be? Selvakumar and Joshna (2011) reported that PPs contribute significantly in enhanci ng BAsso in case of established strong brands such as banks where as PPs have no effect on BAsso in case of fast food restaurants.   Winer (1986) concluded that PP has a negative significant effect on BAsso because PP‘s conveys an image of low and unstable  quality. So if PP‘s are used, then it should be kept in mind that they are in line with the desired positioning strategy. If a value positioning is chosen, that promises high quality at low price then marketing team must ensure that in order to minimize t he price quality is not compromised.  But if organization wants to establish its brand as a high end brand then they need to be cautious while using PP strategy because many a times it has turned sour and affected the other Brand Associations negatively (S tibel, 2008). Based on the above evaluation of literature hypothesis 4 is formulated.   Hypothesis 4: PP contributes significantly to BAsso  Basso - PQ and BL  Literature survey on the relationship between BAsso and BL has indicated mixed results. Some studie s have found significant positive effect of Basso on BL (Falahat et al. 2018) based on a study carried out on  hardware retail stores in Malasia and Alhaddad, (2015) based on a study done on sports wear retail stores. Erfan and Choon (2013), Severi and Ling (2013) also found strong positive relationship between BAsso and BL.  On the other hand Kieu (2016), Chinomona and Maziriri (2017) did not find any effect of BAsso on BL based on a study completed on shopping malls in Vietnam. Based on the above revie w of literature following hypothesis 5 and 6 are framed:   Hypothesis 5:  BAsso significantly contributes to BL  Hypothesis 6: BAsso contributes significantly to PQ   BA – BL and PQ  The findings of previous studies have indicated mixed results on the relationsh ip between BA and BL. Conceptually BL is not possible without the awareness of the customers about the brand.  Oh (2000) reported insignificant positive relationship between BA and PQ. Chinomona and Maziriri (2017) found insignificant relationship bitween BA and BL where as Malik, Gafoor and Iqbal (2013), Jing, Pitsaphol and Shabbir (2014), Dhurup, Mafini and Dumasi (2014), Xu, Li and Zhou (2015), Hendra and Budi (2017) found positive relationship between BA and BL in their studies. Hussain et al. (2017) fo und significant positive effect of BA on BL and BAsso for users and non users both in a study conducted on mobile phone brands. Chi, Yeh and Yang (2009) reported positive significant positive effect of BA on BL and PQ. Therefore, looking at the empirical e vidence hypotheses 7 and 8 are framed:   Hypothesis 7:  BA contributes significantly to BL Hypothesis 8:  BA significantly contributes to PQ BA and BAsso as Mediators  Shintaputri, and Wuisan (2017) did not find BA as mediator of relationship between PP and BL in a study carried out on a well known mobile brand. However, Beneke, Flynn, Greig, & Mukaiwa (2013), Buditama & Aksari (2017) reported that the PP -BL relationship  is partially mediated by BA. The authors did not find any research work that evaluated PQ as mediator of PP -BAsso relationship.   Hypothesis 9: BAsso significantly mediates the relationship between PP and BL  Hypothesis 10: BAsso significantly mediates the relationship between PP and PQ  Hypothesis 11: BA significantly mediates the relationship between PP and BL  Hypothesis 12: BA significantly mediates the relationship between PP and PQ   RESEARCH METHODOLOGY  We evaluated the causal effect of PP on BL and BA with PQ and BA acting as mediating variables on online stores (Flip Kart, Amazon,
	 
	 129  Snap Deal). Survey method was used for collecting the data for the research. The study was done to evaluate the effect of price promotions on the elements of brand equity and to evaluate the mediating role of PQ and BA.  The research was conducted using UG and PG students studying in various Institutions located at Gwalior region in the state of Madhya Pradesh (India) as respondents. The students who attended the Institutions during the data collection phase formed the sample frame for the study (Lim & Ting, 2012). Since the Institutions were not ready to provide the complete list of students and their contact details, the students were selected for the study based on non proba bility quota sampling method. Equal number of male and female students was selected for providing responses. The data was collected after meeting the respondents face -to-face. In all 350 questionnaires were distributed to the students for collecting respon ses.  All the 350 questionnaires were collected and 325 questionnaires were found with responses on all the statements. Thus, the final sample size was 325 ( Klenke, 2008) .  StandardizedQuestionnaires of PQ, BL, BA, BAsso, as well as PP, proposed by Nurcahya (2014) were used for data collection. 7 -point Liker type scale was used for data collection.  Cronbach‘s alpha is a prominent tool for evaluating internal consistency reli ability for the measures (Perry, 2001; Rogelberg, 2002). Cronbach‘s Alpha coefficient of reliability was computed to establish the reliability of all the measures used in the study.   EFA was used to identify the factors underlying the measures.  Principle  Axis Factoring (PAF)  (Conway & Huffcutt, 2003)  was applied to identify factors of the measures  (Fabrigar et al. 1999; Beavers et al. 2013) .   PLS-SEM is preferred over CB -SEM in evaluating predictive causal relationships in a complex model (Rigdon, 2012, 2014). Also PLS-SEM uses better algorithm for evaluating descriminent validity ( Franke and Sarstedt, 2019) . Therefore, PLS -SEM was used to test the structural model as the model comprising of five variables and 19 indicators was complex and causal relationships were evaluated.    RESULT AND DISCUSSION  Nunally's (1978); Lance, Butts & Michels (2006) Identified necessary conditions for considering a measure as reliable and stated that reliability coefficient values above 0.7 indicate that the measure is Reliable. Table 1 displays the Cronbach‘s Alpha val ues for all the measures. It is evident that all the coefficients are higher than 0.7; therefore, all the measures are reliable.   KMO values need to be higher than 0.5 for the data to be from a sample that is large enough for factor analysis. Table 2 shows  the KMO values for all the measures. It is evident that all the KMO values are higher than 0.5 indicating that the sample was adequate for Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA). The Bartlett‘s test compares the computed item -to-item correlation values with th e correlations in identity matrix. The two matrices must be different for the data to be suitable for EFA. Table 2 also indicates that the Chi Square test values are significant at 0.0 level of significance indicating, that the item -to-item correlation matrices for all the measures are not identity matrices. Therefore, the data obtained through all the variables are suitable for EFA.   Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA)  EFA was conducted using Principle Axis Factoring for convergence and Varimax for rotation on PQ, BL, BA, BAsso and PP to identify the underlying factors of the measures. All the measures of the study converged on single factors only; therefore, the names of the variables were used for representing the factors.   Structural Equation Modeling Resu lts  The Structural model consisting of variables;  Price Promotion (PP), Brand Awareness (BA), Service Quality (SQ), Brand Association (BAss), Brand Loyalty (BL) was tested using Smart PLS (Fig
	.1). These variables were measured using a number of items (indicators). Since EFA converged on single factors for all the variables, structural model was constructed using five variables with their sixteen indicators.   
	 130  Although computing goodness of fit indices is not essential for SEM models tested using Smart PLS. Some of the selected goodness of indices are used to demonstrate that the model had high goodness of fit (Table 3).   1. SRMR (Standardized Root Mean Square Residual) - The value of SRMR need to be below 0.08 for the model to have high fit with data ( Hu and Bentler, 1999 ). The computed value for SRMR is 0.058; showing that the model has high goodness of fit.   2. NFI (Normed Fit  Index) - The value of NFI should be greater than 0.9 for the model to have goodness of fit ( Lohmöller, 1989). The computed value of NFI is 0.917. Thus, the model has high goodness of fit.   Convergent Validity  Convergent validity indicates the relationship  between indicators of a variable (Carmines and Zeller, 1979). Three parameters of the model indicate whether the variables have convergent validity. The parameters are: Factor Loadings (Outer Loadings), Construct Reliability (CR) and Average Variance Expl ained (AVE).   Outer Loadings  The model consists of five variables interrelated as indicated in the model diagram (Fig. 1) along with their indicators. The outer loadings indicate the factor loads of all the indicators on their variables. The loadings must  be higher than 0.7 or very close to them. All the indicators in the current model have are higher than 0.7 other than one indicator of Brand Awareness, which has a loading of a 0.683 that is very close to 0.7 (Table 4). Thus, the first criterion for conve rgent validity is satisfied.   Composite Validity (CV)  The second criteria for establishing CV is construct reliability (CR). The CR of all the variables must be higher than 0.7 for demonstrating CV.  However, the value higher than 0.6 are acceptable if the  research is exploratory in nature (Bagozzi and Yi, 1988). Table 5 displays CRs for all the variables. Since all the CR values are greater than 0.8, the second criterion for convergent validity is also fulfilled.    AVE  The third and final criterion for est ablishing convergent validity is the AVE. According to Fornell and Larcker, 1981, AVE evaluates the average variance that a construct extracts from its indicators in comparison to measurement error calculated for each variable. According to Bagozzi & Yi (1 988) and Chin (1998) the values of AVE should exceed 0.5; that means the variables are able to extract at least 50% of the total variance. Therefore, AVE values above 0.5 fulfill the third criteria for high convergent validity. As displayed in the table -5, all the AVE values are higher than 0.5.  Thus, the third criterion for the convergent validity of all the variables of the study is also fulfilled. In other words, the variables included in the model have high convergent validity.   Discriminant Validity  As the convergent validity indicates homogeneity of variables of a construct the discriminant validity demonstrates the separation/differentiation of each constructs from the other constructs of the model (Carmines and Zeller, 1979).  The discriminant vali dity is demonstrated by AVE values that are higher than 0.5. All the AVEs should be higher than all the inter -construct correlations (Chin, 1998). Square Root of AVEs are placed on the diagonal and the inter -construct correlations are placed on off diagona l cells in the matrix. If the diagonal elements are higher than the off diagonal values in the corresponding rows and columns the discriminant validity is established. Therefore, discriminant validity is established for this model as all the diagonal value s are higher than off diagonal values in the corresponding rows and columns (Table 6).   Hypothesis Testing  In structural models the hypotheses are tested by computing path coefficients (β). The path coefficients in SEM indicate causal relationship between the constructs (Wixom and Watson, 2001). Table 7 shows hypothesized path coefficients (β)
	.   Bootstrapping  Although the coefficient β values indicate causal relationship they are not sufficient to indicate whether this relationship is significant. Bootstrap ping procedure evaluates 
	 131  whether these relationships are significant (Chin‘s, 1998). Bootstrapping with 500 sub -samples was performed to evaluate whether the relationships between constructs were significant. Boot strapping computed t -statistic for each pa th coefficient (β). If the t - statistic value was 1.96 or greater, the hypothesis was considered supported, otherwise the hypothesis was not supported. Table -7 shows t statistics values for all the inter -construct relationships.   SEM diagram with t -value s computed using Bootstrapping procedure is displayed at fig -2.  Hypothesis 1: PP contributes significantly to BAsso   The hypothesis was tested through computation of path coefficient beta (β). The computed β value between PP and BA  was 0.614. The standardized β was tested through computation of‗t‘ statistic. The value of‗t‘ was 10.920  significant at .000 level of significance. Thus, the null hypothesis is supported.  Tebebe and Singh (2016) found significant effect of PP on BAsso in  a study on Brewery Industry.   Hypothesis 2: PP contributes significantly to BA The hypothesis was tested through computation of path coefficient beta (β). The computed β value between PP and BA  was 0.641. The standardized β was tested through computation of ‗t‘ statistic. The value of ‗t‘ was 10.872  significant at .000 level of significance. Thus, the null hypothesis is supported.  Tebebe and Singh (2016) found significant effect of Monetary (Price) Promotion on BA in a study on Brewery Industry. Rungtraku lchai (2015) also found strong causal relationship between PP and BA in a study on luxury Brands.   Hypothesis 3: PP contributes significantly to BL The hypothesis was tested through computation of path coefficient beta (β). The computed β value between PP and BL  was 0.115. The standardized β was tested through computation of ‗t‘ statistic. The value of ‗t‘ was 1.732  significant at .084 level of significance. Thus, the null hypothesis is not supported.  Results are in line with the findings of Rungtrakulchai  and Nichi (2015) where they did not find any causal relationship between PP and BL in a study on luxury Brands.   Hypothesis 4: PP contributes significantly to PQ The hypothesis was tested through computation of path coefficient beta (β). The computed β value between PP and PQ  was 0.251. The standardized β was tested through computation of ‗t‘ statistic. The value of ‗t‘ was 3.728  significant at .000 level of significance. Thus, the null hypothesis is supported.    Hypothesis 5: PQ significantly contribute s to BL The hypothesis was tested through computation of path coefficient beta (β). The computed β value between PQ and BA  was 0.398. The standardized β was tested through computation of ‗t‘ statistic. The value of ‗t‘ was 5.152  significant at .000 level of significance. Thus, the null hypothesis is supported.  Loureiro (2013) also found similar results while evaluating the effect of PQ on BL in a study on Internet Banking. Alhaddad (2015) found significant effect of PQ on BL in a sports wear study. Chinomona and Maziriri (2017) also reported positive contribution of PQ on BL.  Hypothesis 6:  BAsso  contributes significantly to PQ  The hypothesis was tested through computation of path coefficient beta (β). The computed β value between BAsso and PQ was 0.214. The standardized β was tested through computation of ‗t‘ statistic. The value of ‗t‘ was 2.859  significant at .004 level of significance. Thus, the null hypothesis is supported.  Alexandris et al. (2008) reported similar findings based on a study on fitness clubs.   Hypothesis 7:  BAsso significantly contributes to BL  BAsso does not contribute significantly to BL as indicated by the path coefficients va lue (β) = 0.117. The relationship is tested using t -statistic; the value of t is 1.737, significant at 8.3% level of significance. Result is in contrast with the findings of Homburg et al
	. (2010), Chen, Yeh and Jheng (2013) and Hussain et al. (2017) where in the authors found significant effect of BAsso on BL in their study on personal computer industry.   
	 132  Hypothesis 8:  BA contributes significantly to BL BA contributes significantly to BL as indicated by the path coefficient (β) = 0.233. The path coefficient  is tested for significance using t -test. The value of t -test statistic is 2.831, significant at 0.5% level of significance. Thus, the hypothesis is supported .  Similar results were obtained by Abbas (2019) where the authors found significant effect of BA of higher Education Institutions on their BL. Dhurup , et. al. (2014) also found significant causal relationship  of BA on BL in a study on Retail outlets. The results of Malik et al. (2013) also found strong positive relationship of BA on BL in a service sector study providing support to the finding of this study.   Hypothesis 9:  BA contributes significantly to PQ BA has significant affect on PQ. The relationship was tested through the path coefficient β. The value of β was 0.316; tested through computation of ‗t‘= 4.842 significant at 0% level of significance. Therefore the hypothesis is supported.   Mediation Effe ct Hypothesis 10: PQ significantly mediates the relationship between PP and BL  Mediation effect of PQ on the relationship between PP and BL was evaluated through computation of indirect effect of Price Promotion on Brand Loyalty. The total indirect effect of PP on BL is evaluated through computation of standardized β; the value of β was 0.104. The standardized β was tested through computation of ‗t‘ statistic; the value of ‗t‘ was 2.520, significant at 0.012. Thus, the null hypothesis if supported. The PQ significantly mediates the relationship between PP and BL. Saif et al. (2019) also found that PQ fully mediated the relationship between PP and BL in a study on Apparel Industry, thus supporting the results of this study.   Hypothesis 11: PQ significantly me diates the relationship between PP and BAssso  Mediation effect of PQ on the relationship between PP and BAsso was evaluated through computation of indirect effect of PP on BAsso. The total indirect effect of PP on BAsso was evaluated through computation of  standardized β; the value of β was  0.244. The standardized β was tested through computation of ‗t‘ statistic; the value of ‗t‘ was 5.095, significant at 0.000. Thus, the null hypothesis if supported. The PQ significantly mediates the relationship between PP and BAsso.   Hypothesis 12: BA significantly mediates the relationship between PP and BL  Mediation effect of BA on the relationship between PP and BL was evaluated through computation of indirect effect of PP on BL. The total indirect effect of PP on BL is evaluated through computation of standardized β; the value of β was  0.287. The standardized β was tested through computation of ‗t‘; the value of ‗t‘ was 5.793, significant at 0.000. Thus, the null hypothesis if supported. The BA significantly mediates the relationship between PP and BL.   Hypothesis 13: BA significantly mediates the relationship between PP and BAsso  Mediation effect of BA on the relationship between PP and BAsso was evaluated through computation of indirect effect of PP on BAsso. The tot al indirect effect of PP on BAsso is evaluated through computation of standardized β; the value of β was  0.183. The standardized β was tested through computation of ‗t‘ statistic; the value of ‗t‘ was 3.461, significant at 0.001. Thus, the null hypothesis if supported. The BA significantly mediates the relationship between PP and BAsso.   We could not locate any study that evaluated the mediating role played by PQ on the relationship between PPs and BAsso. Similarly, we did not find any study that evaluated the mediating role played by BA on the relationship between PPs with BAsso. and BL.    IMPLICATIONS & CONCLUSION  The study has found significant causal relationship between PP and all the elements of BE of the online stores. In physical stores case a large number of studies have indicated that repeated or long term use of PPs have adverse  effect on some of the elements of BE (Winer, 1986 and Rahmani, Mojavery & Allahbakhsh, 2012)
	.    However, the current study has provided a new insight that PP in case of online stores positively and significantly effects all the elements of BE. The result s of the study 
	 133  support the view that the Online Stores may continue using repeated PP bursts to improve their sales and simultaneously improving their BE.   The study has made very important contribution in evaluating the mediating role played by PQ and BA  on the contribution of PP on BL and BAsso. The study has clearly identified the significant role played by the two mediating variables, PQ and BA. Thus, the organizations that have high PQ will be able to improve BL and BAsso, while increasing its sales t hrough price promotion. Similarly, higher BA also provides opportunity to the organization to utilize PP for sales improvement and simultaneously improve BL and BAsso.

The research methodology comprises of aclose -ended questionnaire, which records not only the demographic and socioeconomic details but also, objectivel y quantifies the qualitative aspects of expressiveness in an individual. Results of 220 respondentswereanalyzed usingSPSS. Thereafter, a predictive model of expressiveness was created using Regression Analysis. Considering a significance level of 10%, majo r findings indicate that factors like the education level, openness to the opposite gender, number of friends, family income, occupation of the mother, highest level of education attained by the father, and expression in front of a stranger are significant . Research implications suggest that schools and Institutes should design curriculums which encourage students to participate in team -building and other leadership activities in order to boost their expressiveness .   Keywords: Expressiveness, Demographic F actors, Self -Perception, Education level, Predictive Model   INTRODUCTION  The world today has multiple avenues for millennials and generation Z in terms of job prospects. There are diverse fields that an individual can explore. Among the host of opportunities prevalent in the current scenario, the youth today is oriented towards finding jobs in the technical, administrative and sales sectors, which is different from the earlier trend  where the thrust was more towards finding jobs related to sectors in managerial, executive and professionally specialized areas (Ryscavage, P., 1993). Nevertheless, no matter what the preferred job sector might be, the fact remains that employees hired by  organizations are sought on the basis oftheir personality, the knowledge that they carry in a particular domain, interpersonal skills and soft skills.   The objective of companies is to hire employees who are adept at improving workforce productivity, whic h in turn, would naturally increase productivity in the company (Winkler, S., König, C., & Kleinmann, M., 2013). In addition to this, with changes in both the nature of work and the workplace, employers today have new expectations from their employees (Mor ris M and Massie P., 1999). Resultantly, cognitive skills are highly valued considering the ever -changing nature of jobs. Furthermore, with the latest buzzword being ―sustainability,‖ it is imperative that employees today are flexible and adept in their at titudes. Employees being sought out need to be able to learn rapidly and possess good generic skills (Maclean and Ordonez, 2007). Companies seek individuals who would be employable for longer durations to ensure stability within the organization. This furt her implies that if one wants to be employable, an individual should be responsive to changing demands in the industry in terms of skill sets required for a particular job (Sanders & De Grip, Fugate et al, 2004).   With a huge emphasis on soft skills, there  lies even a greater thrust on hiring employees according to their personality profile, depending on the nature of their respective jobs.  For example, it would be ideal to hire extroverts, especially if the job entails interactions with the outside world
	.  In an 
	 144  interview on Radio‘s Employability Mix, the General Manager, George Fiacchi stated that on-air personalities are generally more extroverted as compared to the administration staff who are introverted (Advertiser, The Adelaide, 8th December 2007). Ex troverts have the ability to think fast and act accordingly. Other characteristics of an extrovert include being good at building networks, speaking while thinking, and generating ideas during conversations. They are good at team collaborations, generating  ideas while talking and they simply adore attention given to them. It is stated that companies should prefer having face -to-face conversations with extroverts in order to collaborate on their views and ideas (Kahnweiler, J. B., 2011).   On the other hand, traits of introverts include thinking before speaking, knowing more than they project, and they happen to work well under little supervision. An interesting fact is that many researches publications state that the population is made up of 25% introverts (Edelberg, G. S., 2006).   Whether we consider traits of an extrovert or an introvert, there is a level of expressiveness involved in both. It may further be added that culture has a major role to play in individuals being either introverted or extroverted, thereby affecting their expressiveness. That is to say, low context cultures believe in open and frank communication which leads them towards extraversion. However, in high context cultures, where meaning is implied, people tend to be veered towards introve rsion. Nevertheless, any given culture displays fluidity between high and low contexts, depending upon the circumstances. Similarly, an individual also tends to display traits that can either be introvert or extrovert, subjectupon the circumstances. Depend ing upon various factors, an individual may be skewed more towards introversion or extraversion.  Based on the same, it is interesting note the level of expressiveness in both cases and factors that affect it.   In current times, the role of media and socia l on-line platforms on the expressiveness of individuals cannot be denied. According to Mangla and Manisha (2019), media plays a strong role as far as social responsiblities of individuals are concerned. In another study by Arjun and Rai (2018), the concep ts of online trolling, bullying, abuse and rampant social media trial are explored. Utpal (2017) traces the patterns of student engagement, usage and network patterns and routine activitieson Facebook. Quite clearly, social media and media also tend to aff ect the way individuals express themselves.   Based upon demographic and socio -economic factors, the various research questions framed to analyse expressiveness are as follows;   RQ 1: Does age of an Individual affect his/her expressive behavior?  RQ 2: Is one better able to express oneself in his/her mother tongue?  RQ 3: Does one‘s gender affect the expressive behavior of an individual?  RQ 4: Does the type of place one belongs to affect the expressive behavior of an individual?  RQ 5: Does the medium of Education a ffect the degree of expressiveness in a person?  RQ 6: Does Convent Education affect the expressive behavior of a person?  RQ 7: Does Family Composition affect the expressive behavior in an individual?  RQ 8: Do the number of siblings affect the degree of expressiveness in a person?  RQ 9: Does the education level affect the level of expressiveness?  RQ 10: Does openness to the opposite gender affect expressiveness?  RQ 11: Do the number of friendsinfluence expressiveness?  RQ 12: Does family income affect expressiveness?  RQ 13: Does the education level of parents have an effect on expressiveness?  RQ 14:  Can articulating in front of a stranger have an impact on expressiveness?   Primarily, the objective is to analyse an individual‘s basic details, family det ails and level of expressivess with respect to the research questions framed above
	. Thereafter, based on the information provided, the research proposes a predidictive model of expressiveness based on self -perception.   LITERATURE REVIEW  Before coming to th e term ―expressiveness,‖ it‘s imperative to understand the terms ―introvert and extrovert‖ as well. The term ―introvert,‖ according to The Cambridge University has been defined as ―someone who 
	 145  is shy, quiet, and prefers to spend time alone rather than ofte n being with other people.‖ On the other hand, the definition of an extrovert in the same dictionary has been stated as ―an energetic person who enjoys being with other people: Most salespeople are extroverts.‖   Further definitions are as follows; "(1) Introvert: An individual in whom exists an exaggeration of the thought processes in relation to directly observable social behavior, with an accompanying tendency to withdraw from social contacts. (2) Extrovert: An individual in whom exists a diminution of th e thought processes in relation to directly observable social behavior, with an accompanying tendency to make social contacts." (Wikipedia)   Similarly, the term ―expressiveness,‖ as defined in the Cambridge Dictionary is; ―the state of showing what someone  thinks or feels.‖ According to Kozhina, expressiveness is a ― speech structure, fulfilling the communication purposes and aims at attaining the highest degree of communication effectiveness‖ (Kozhina, 1987). Therfore, it can be said that expressiveness is a mode of communication which enhances utterance.  Tracing the history of introverts and extroverts, they were first introduced by Carl Jung, the Swiss psychiatrist. Jung has described an introvert as person who withdraws into oneself, especially during emo tionally stressful and conflicting times. Another feature of an introvert is the tendency to be shy and to work in solitude. On the other hand, in stark comparison to the introvert, the extrovert seeks others‘ company during stressful times and is more soc iable by nature.  Hans Eysenck‘s research lists two main dimensions of personality which account for different traits among persons we come across; they are extroversion and introversion. Eysenck has described the characteristics of an introverted person as  being unsociable, reserved, pessimistic, anxious and moody. On the other hand, the qualities of an extrovert are that one is sociable, optimistic, carefree and lively. (Eysenck and Eysenck, 1963).   There have been various researches which have attempted t o explore the relationship between personality and the occupation that an individual opts for. According to Filer (1986), an individual‘s occupational prediction should not be based upon salary but on an individual‘s tastes and productive attributes. These  productive attributes are inclusive of educational background, experience and personality trait which make certain individuals more suited for a particular job.   Career Needs Theory states that differences in occupation are caused by selective factors or pressures that an occupation wields upon the individual. Super and Crites have stressed upon the importance of understanding personality and its influence on an individual‘s vocational choice. According to them, ―every individual has certain abilities, interests, personality traits, and other characteristics which, if he/she knows them and their potential value, will make him/her a happier man/woman, a more effective worker, and a more useful citizen.‖ (Super and Crites, 1962)   There have been various other  researches which have investigated factors affecting introversion and extraversion.  According to Vidhu Mohan and Dalip Kumar (1976), their research on ―The Qualitative Analysis of the Performance of Introverts and Extroverts on Standard Progressive Matri ces‖ points towards the initial superiority of extroverts over introverts. Interestingly, the research further proved that with increased time duration and increased level of difficulty, introverts showed better performance.   Eysenck (1967) has clearly sta ted that difference in the intellect of an individual might be based upon personality dimensions of Extraversion/Introversion (E/I) and Neuroticism (N). Nevertheless, the relation between E/I and intelligence is found to be linear and negative (Lynn & Gord on, 1961; Child, 1964; Madan, 1967; Eysenck, 1967)
	. Resultantly, introverts opt for accuracy whereas, speed is opted for by extroverts. In addition to this, extraversion is significantly related to entrepreneurial potential (R. Zeffane, 2013).   It is on the basis of personality traits that organizations today seek people who would fit into their culture and add value to it. Therefore, it is not just conceptual knowledge which is sought after but also interpersonal skills and passion for a given job profil e. To get the perfect fit, as far as passion is 
	 146  concerned, companies should hire people on the basis of ―Big Five‖ This is a statistical technique which began in 90‘s. It is based on factor analysis. These five factors have developed from careful "meta -analyses" (McCrae & Costa., 2002) and have stood true to various cultures and countries. They are the universals of personality and they include; Extraversion vs. Introversion, Conscientiousness vs. Un -directedness, Agreeableness vs. Antagonism, Emotional Stability vs. Neuroticism and Openness vs. Closed to Experience   The big five are used majorly in professional development and testing. Based on the above, while an extrovert would want to work with others and social activities, an introvert would prefer stic king around in one corner and working alone in a quiet environment.  Further research conducted in this regard is with specific reference to social media. This is considering the fact that we live in a hyper -mediated world around us and that youth today is highly active on the social media. In fact, the manner in which introverts present themselves on -line is way different from extroverts. As it is, introverts present their ―real -selves‖ online whereas extroverts present their ―real -side‖ through traditional  and social interaction (Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., 2002).   With such a close link between an individual‘s personality trait and job occupation, Management Institutes across the globe aim at identifying personalities of an individual and specifically counsell ing students on the jobs that they should take up in the future. The aim is to identify and match students on the basis of their personality profile to a job best suited for them. Resultantly, there are a host of electives which management institutes offer  today to cater to a vista of opportunities in various industries across all sectors.   It cannot be denied that there is a direct link between the personality of the individual and his/her impact on the working style and his/ her performance. Interestingly , many researches establish a relation between the student and his/ her academic performance, choice of electives and that of career (Tett et al., 1991; and Singh, 1994). Therefore, an analysis of familial, demographic and socio -economic factors which cont ribute to expressiveness in an individual can not only aid managerial students into the kind of job that they should opt for, but also give an insight to soft skill trainers, career counsellors and psychologists in selecting and adopting appropriate traini ng techniques thereby facilitating students acquire the required skill sets for a specific job.   OBJECTIVE OF RESEARCH  The aim of this paper is to chalk out factors that influence expressiveness in the Indian youth of today with specific reference to the family, demographics and socioeconomics. The factors taken into account include the role of family, upbringing, education and expressiveness in terms of social media. The idea is to understand major contributors as far as expressiveness is concerned and pre dict a model for the same.   Since this paper explores the familial aspect and its effect on Indian youth as far as expressiveness is concerned, it would be ideal to understand the family composition of the Indian community. Indians, by far, have always bee n a people who have thrived in communities. The Indian society is one which is both collectivistic and interdependent (Chadda RK, Deb KS, 2013). In addition to this, it promotes social cohesion (Chadda RK, Deb KS, 2013).  Collectivism has been defined as ―a sense of harmony, interdependence and concern for others‖ (C. Hui and H. Triandis, 1985). Tracing back yesteryears, the concept, as far as families were concerned, used to be that of a joint one. The idea behind joint families was quite simple; a large g roup of people who belong to a similar bloodline, living together to give each other support and care
	. India is majorly a patriarchal society (barring a few regions in the South). In it, the head of the family, who is a male, is responsible for the well -being of all and is also ―the‖ decision maker. Obviously, children who are born and bred in joint families have rules to adhere to along with prescribed codes of conduct. There is a code of conduct meant for each and every member of the household. For exampl e, while females are bearers of offspring, their key responsibility is raising children, both their own and of others in the family, while also taking care of the kitchen. In earlier days, there used to be one kitchen in which food used to be cooked for ma ny members. The   males had to take care of errands outside the four walls 
	 147  of the home. This entailed farming, merchandising or running business.   Now, children in these families had their perspectives built on what they saw and what they heard. Furthermor e, it was considered bad manners to speak when elders were in conversation. Obviously, it can be safely concluded that these traits had an impact on their overall personality. Resultantly, it can be inferred that children belonging to joint families were l ess expressive unless they belonged to the younger lot, where one could get away with whatever they said or did, on grounds of being the youngest.   However, the current trend of the Indian family scenario centers on the nuclear pattern. Furthermore, as com pared to earlier times, around a decade back, a nuclear family consisted of the mother, father and two kids. Today, however, the nuclear family comprises of the mother, the father and single child. In addition to this, with the rise in urban cities and met ros, there also happens to be a rise in the number of divorces which results in a higher number of single parents.  Resultantly, this new structure is giving rise to a generation which has a different way of processing information and expressing it. This can majorly be contributed to the rise of social media and the ever -increasing usage of cell phones, embedded with a plethora of apps. Ideally, if children today above the age of 25are able to express themselves freely, both on-line and off -line, they shoul d be more expressive in terms of personality. In addition to the family, there are external factors may influence expressiveness in an individual. These include demographic and socio -economic factors. The aim of this paper is to identifythe factors which a ffect youngsters and draw attention to factors affecting expressiveness therein. Thereafter, the paper proposes a predictive model of expressiveness.   METHODOLOGY  For this research, a Google document with close -ended questions was shared with students belo nging to five Institutes in Uttar Pradesh and Mumbai. There was a total of 220 respondents for the same. All the respondents had filled the questionnaire in totality. Therefore, there were no invalid responses.   The questionnaire focused on various paramet ers in order to understand factors affecting expressiveness. It was divided into three sections, wherein the first section focused on basic information which included the individual‘s age, gender, background, level of education, medium of education, religi on, community and the number of close friends.   The second portion of the questionnaire aimed at understanding the individual‘s family background. Questions in this section focused on the annual income in the family, the occupation of the father and his hi ghest degree, the occupation of the mother and her highest degree, the family composition and number of siblings.   The third and final section was based on expressiveness of the individual based on self -perception, on a Likert scale of five wherein one was  the least and five, the maximum. The respondent stated whether he/ she is able to express views freely in front of a stranger, is comfortable discussing sensitive issues with parents, friends and members of the opposite gender, the level of expressiveness  on social/ digital platforms, on a one -to-one level, level expressiveness in front of the mother and before an audience which is biased and whether the individual thinks of himself/ herself as an introvert or an extrovert. There were only two questions in  this section which were based on a simple ―yes‖ or ―no.‖ The questions were; whether or not the person has been a) sexually harassed or b) bullied in their lifetime.   RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  On the basis of the above questionnaire, results of all 220 respondents were run through SPSS. In addition to this, regression was applied on certain factors.   Furthermore, the advanced phase of the research is based on identifying some of the factors which might affect the degree of expression in an individual usi ng predictive tools on SPSS software
	.   Regression technique is used on the said data where the degree of expression is taken as a dependent variable and a linear model has been created using the various other factors, like age, location, gender, income etc ., as the 
	 148  independent variables. The following equation is proposed;   E=β 0+β1x1+β2x2+β3x3+⋯+βnxn+e  The above -mentioned equation tries to make a linear model which is able to predict the factors affecting Expression / Expressiveness of an individual. Where  ‗E‘ stands for the level or degree of Expression of an individual. ‗β 0‘ is the constant, ‗β 1‘ is the unstandardized coefficient for the factor ‗x 1.‘ Similarly, ‗β 2‘ is the unstandardized coefficient for the factor ‗x2.‘ Progressively, ‗β n‘ is the unstanda rdized coefficient of the ‗n th‘ factor (x n) is taken into consideration.   At first, dummy variables were created for the categorical variables (Annexure A). Thereafter, the Descriptive Statistics of the data was listed. It is as follows;   The Descriptive s tatistics gives us the following information;   Majority of the respondents belong to an age group of 18 -22 followed by 22 -25, are males, belong to an urban setting, are well educated (45% postgraduates, 34% graduates), and are educated in the English mediu m. 55% of the respondents have been educated in a Convent School (92%). Around 43% respondents have 2-5 close friends. The major chunk of respondents belongs to below 5 lakh annual income group (35%), 5 -8 lakh annual income group (28.18%). 52% of the parti cipants have their fathers working in a salaried job. However, when it comes to mothers, 85% of the respondents have their mothers as Home - Makers. The majority of responders have their father‘s highest educational qualification as graduates (53%) and so i s it the case with Mother‘s highest education (47%). It is strange that majority of the mothers who are well educated in the Indian subcontinent prefer giving huge importance to their roles as a homemaker in the family and they give up their careers and ot her ambitions.   Most of the respondents have been bred in a nuclear family setting. Majority of the respondents have 1 -2 siblings, have neither been bullied in their lives, nor have faced any form of harassment. In addition to this, majority of the respondents seem comfortable in expressing themselves, apart from discussing the sensitive issues like sexual life, puberty and periods with their parents, where the mean is relatively low (3.07).   The R square and Adjusted R square values are 0.415 and 0. 280, respectively. The Durbin Watson is 2.117 signifying the absence of autocorrelation in the residuals.

No  RQ 2: Is one better able to express oneself in his/her mother tongue
	? No  
	 153  RQ 3: Does one‘s gender affect the expressive behavior of an individual? No  RQ 4: Does the type of place one belongs to affect the expressive behavior of an individual? No  RQ 5: Does the medium of Education affect the degree of expressiveness in a person? No  RQ 6: Does Convent Education affect the expressive behavior of a person? No  RQ 7: Does Family Composition affect the expressive behavior in an individual? No  RQ 8: Do the number of siblings affect the degree of expressiveness in a person? No  RQ 9: Does the education level affect the level of expressiveness? Yes  RQ 10: Does openness to  the opposite gender affect expressiveness? Yes  RQ 11: Do the Number of friends influence Expressiveness?  Yes  RQ 12: Does family income affect expressiveness? Yes  RQ 13: Does the education level of parents have an effect on expressiveness? Yes  RQ 14:  Can articulating in front of a stranger have an impact on expressiveness? Yes   That is to say, contrary to many myths and beliefs, demographic factors, the mother tongue, etc. do not affect the expressiveness of an individual. The predictive model does not consider these factors as significant. Furthermore, considering the significance of ‗ ‘ to th e level of 10% or 0.10, the following factors are significant;  1. Whether an individual is able to express himself in front of a stranger.  2. If an individual is comfortable in opening up or speaking his/ her mind in front of the opposite gender.  3. Where the highe st Educational qualification is Graduation.  4. Where the highest Educational qualification is High School.  5. People who have more than 5 friends in whom one can confide in.  6. People with household family income between 5 -8 lakhs per annum.  7. Where the Mother is emp loyed in a salaried job.  8. Where the father has highest Education as a professional course like Engineering/ MBBS/CA/MBA etc.   On taking into account the coefficients of factors which have shown significance through analysis, we have the following output:   It can be seen that none of the coefficients are greater than 1 or less than -1. This is suggestive that there are many factors which affect an individual‘s expressiveness, depending upon the various experiences which s/he might have faced in his/her life.  This includes the type of surroundings where one has grown up during early childhood days. In addition to this, there are some factors which affect  expressiveness such as the number of friends one has (which has a positive Coefficient of 0.304), expressi on in front of a stranger(0.301), expression in front of the opposite gender(0.171), Highest Educational Qualification of Graduate( -0.316) and High School( -0.517), Household income between 5 -8 lakhs p.a.( -0.359), Mother is employed in a salaried job( -0.559 ) and Highest education of father is a Professional degree course like Engineering/MBBS/CA/MBA etc . (-0.554)   CONCLUSION/ IMPLICATIONS  Based on the above results, points which can be concluded from the predictive model of expressiveness are as follows;  i) Friendship is definitely a strong bond which boosts expressive in an individual. Friendship is also one of the pillars of Social Development since it gives more emphasis to relationships which a person makes during one‘s lifetime rather than the relationsh ips with which one is born with. Having said this, the first friend which a person gets during the journey of life is one‘s sibling. It is often seen that siblings develop a better bond between themselves which leads to better expression in an individual. This is also proved by the model where the highest Coefficient of 0.545 has been given to the number of siblings. The number of siblings is positively and directly proportional in the Model.  ii) Expressing one‘s views in front of a stranger makes an individual  more confident. In this highly competitive world, it is necessary to convey the right meaning to the right person without any ambiguity
	. Therefore, Schools, Colleges, Managerial Institutes and Universities should lay more emphasis on speaking in front of a crowd. This can be done by 
	 154  building a robust curriculum which focusses on activities that promote expressiveness. At Jaipuria Institute of Management, presentations are encouraged in front of peer groups through project presentations. This forms a valuab le part of the final assessment of a student throughout the program. It can be advised to the Ministry of Human Resource and Development, Government of India, to replicate this Model throughout the country in order to make India a Service Exporter to the W orld and also a Skilled Manpower exporter.  iii) It is also observed that the social structure in the country doesn‘t allow students of opposite genders to intermingle. This is specifically true in Tier II and Tier III cities. This has huge impact on the express ive behaviour of an individual. The participation of women in higher education needs to be boosted. This factor has a positive impact on the degree of expressiveness, as is shown in the results.. In general, with reference to the SDGs, huge emphasis should  be laid upon on the education and participation of females in the workforce of the country.   LIMITATIONS AND SCOPE OF FUTURE STUDY  Since the sample size was not big enough to study the influence of factors affecting expressiveness based on geography that  is, state -wise, further studies may be conducted to analyse the same. A greater geographical area would aid in understanding the impact of socio -cultural and religious factors on expressiveness.  The above findings are preliminary which can be explored in  depth and be validated. The idea is to understand the impact of demography, socio -economics and the family on the expressive behaviour ofan individual.In addition to this, the behaviour of an individual is shaped by many factors which are difficult to qua ntify objectively. Hence, predicting the exact behaviour might be difficult with the present technical expertise but maybe in future, humanity may reach the technical zenith to do so.

The pa per is based on  the language used by radio presenter in contemporary time  and that the  success of messages is not altogether dependent of a standard and established language which has been practiced earlier generation of radio presenter.  Alternate language  patterns use nowadays in radio  sometimes leave deep impression on listeners and  society  in general.  In view of these  facts, the present study attempts to understand the alternate language pattern of  private FM radio stations in India and that too in Hindi centric belt .  In this study,  three  different private radio stations have been taken for the study  and one programme of each station has been analyzed in detail. These three  radio stations are from New Delhi, Chandigarh, and Karnal. The study draws   attention of the a cademia and radio industry on context to perception that despite   popular standard style of presentation and language, there are presenters who are   breaking the monotony of   standard language and it's rules and are more concern with whether the audience w ill be able to   extract   meaning and comprehend it or not. The study explores possibilities of further study to analyze  correlation between decoding of the messages by the listeners and their impact on public communication and its further impact on culture  as well.   Keywords:  Private FM, Radio Station, Language Pattern, Code -Mixing, Radio Jockey, Programme Content .  INTODUCTION  Unprecedented evolution and growth were witnessed in the history of mankind when human became conscious enough to decode their surroundings. Decoding of the surrounding by men didn‘t start with the advent of language only. It had started with the use of si gn & symbols and became a conveyor among early humans. Since the communication is basically meaning making process and a message can create meaning even in sign and symbol and some time silence carries some message; we need to understand the alternate mode  of communication. But, it depends on the fact to what extent the sign and symbol or code language is popular among the community. And after the advent of the language as medium of communication, a large number of languages came into being throughout the w orld.   In the development process various cultures came together resulting into cross culture integration mixed use of the languages from opposite culture. A survey of European commission (2006) states that, 56 respondents were speaking a language other t han their mother tongue e.g., 99 percent people of Luxembourg and 95 of Latvians speak more than one language.    The paper proceeds with argument that, cross culture integration made the mixed use of language a way of life and that needs to be studied in the prism of code switching e.g., using mixture of words of two or more languages while completing a sentence . The scholars (Marian, Shook, 2012) opined that majority of the world‘s population is bilingual or multilingual. They concluded that, bilingual brain has better attention and task switching capacity.   This study looks into the correlations of bilingual culture and use of code switching in media. It further analyzed to what extent media users are receptive to this trend
	. This study proceeds with the idea that, alternate 
	 158 language pattern adopted by private FM radio stations need serious research. It further argues that, private FM radio stations appears to be breaking rules by adopting their own code -mixing type language, but they are becoming a part o f the community. At this point it is pertinent to mention the scholarly argument. According to Al Zabibi and Saleh (2017), when it becomes common practice to switch code e.g., a form of communication wherein speakers switch from one language to other in th e same sentence,  it becomes cultural feature and speech of the community is characterized by it. Some other scholars (Patel and Parikh, 2020) argued that, sentences with phrases from multiple languages are accepted among the various cultures.   In view of t he above theorization by scholars from different disciplines, the paper is an attempt to decipher the meaning making potential of the communication with mixture of code (words) from different languages.   To further elaborate the concept, the paper first of  all defines the various dimensions of term code mixing/code switching. A ‗code‘ is generally used in place of speech variety, language or dialect. Code -mixing or code -switching means when a speaker mixes two or more languages in his/her communication. According to the definition in the Longman Dictionary, ― A person may start speaking one language and then change to another one in the middle of their speech, or sometimes even in the middle of a sentence. On the other hand, code mixing is a mixing of two cod es or languages, usually without a change of topic.‖  Additionally, ―Code mixing involves the assimilation of linguistic elements from one language into another: a sentence begins in one language then makes use of word(s) and grammatical features belonging to another and comes back to the first code.‖ (Chowdhury, 2012). Multilingualism is a normal phenomenon in a country like India, where diverse culture, caste and languages co -exist. People frequently combined words from one language to another which result  is code -mixing. In present scenario, this code -mixing is also a key feature of the RJs to entertain and increase the listenership. They use different languages with various styles to attract and engage the listeners. The paper analyzed this pattern on the  basis of various types of Code Mixing/Switching.   Intra - sentential code - mixing: in this type, mixing occurs within a sentence or a clause. In intra -sentential code -mixing, while speaking a sentence in one language speaker mixes the words from another language .   Inter (Extra) -sentential code -mixing : switching/mixing happens outside the sentence or the clause level. Speaker mixes the whole sentence or clause with one language to another .   Intra -word switching: this switching takes place within a word i tself, like English ‗ movie‘ with Hindi plural turns into ‗movieyaa‘.  (Ahmed  and Tinny   2013: Tashi and Karekatti, 2019). The primary focus of this paper is to discuss the language pattern and content of the programmes broadcasted by private radio stations.   Theoretical perspective of the research  The research draws its theoretical basis from the ‗structural‘ and ‗social linguistic approach‘ of code switching (CS). The structural approach to CS (Boztepe, 2003) is concerned with formation of a sentence in any communication. This branch of study analyzes how a particular way of sentence formation in oral or written communication affects the encoding and decoding. On the other ‗Social Linguistic‘ approach focuses on the aspect, how social meaning is created throu gh CS. It is pertinent to mention here that these two areas underline a number of research problem related to the CS. In view of its importance in this branch of knowledge, the paper deconstructs the sentence formation (using CS) of some selected private r adio stations on standard parameters that helps academia to know its meaning making potential
	. Along with this dimension, it analyses the social linguistic dimension from audiences‘ point of view e.g., to what extent they are at ease with CS in radio jocke ys conversation.  It also tests the conclusion of the scholars in the similar field who states that CS based communication reduce the linguistic distance and helpful to amplify the message and clarify what is said (Mahata et.al. 2020).   In time immemorial, the radio presenter used vocabulary which was not colloquial and hence was not used by a layman or common listeners. Listeners get impressed by the extreme formal language and style of the 
	 159 presenter. But times have changed; now radio jockey presents their programmes in such a language which we use and hear in our day to day lives. They likewise use the age specific language in their programmes. The purpose of this is it to connect with their listeners one to one. Listeners also feel now that the RJ is one of them.   Today,  Radio  jockey  has the freedom  to choosethe way in which he  wants  to present  the programme.  (Ravi, 2012: Kak, 2008)   This study is based on to find out the language pattern and programme‘s content of the various private radio stations. The objective of the programming strategy is to fetch new listeners as well as retrain older listeners. Good listenership base can only be created by very good programming, content, music selection; RJs consist of good performance and connectivity with the aud ience.  It is found that the various studies and researches have done on different private radio stations of various States & cities, but no specific study has taken place on private radio stations operating in Hindi belt cities with reference to the langua ge pattern and content strategy. In this context, this study focused on the analysis of private radios with special reference to their language pattern and content variation.   Programming Format of Private FM Radio Channels  Media allude to aggregate specia lized apparatus that is utilized to convey the data to the huge mass at once; it incorporates print media, electronic media and new media. Lifestyle is the medium to express our life and the content about lifestyle is exceptionally spread by the media ( Paul and Uikey, 2017). Similarly, language is also an essential part of the lifestyle, which could be described as one of the significant types of conversation that executes an essential place in human communication. To understand the language of the programm es broadcasted by private FM radio stations, we need to understand the programming format of them. Private FM radio channels are very different from All India Radio and Community Radio in terms of content, language and presentation. Private FM radio statio ns‘ style is fast, catchy, friendly and interactive. RJs have to represent a lot with few words because they have limited time to speak on -air. ( Spangardt et.al. 2016: Sen, 2014). The paper argues that these radio stations are targeting young listeners and  designed the programme‘s format according to them. According to the scholars Sachdeva and Tripathi (2019), t he young generation is the most important section of the society and also the most powerful for bringing a social change. The size of the youthful people‘s populace decides the development and potential of the nation. Youth is the most significant mass wit h enthusiasm, motivations and persistence for endorsing financial, social and cultural developments of a country.   LITERATURE REVIEW  Researcher reviewed the various research papers, books and articles to study the code -mixing/switching language strategy o f the Radio Jockeys and the programming content of the various radio stations running in India and internationally. To examine the language pattern of the radio presenters and programme‘s content of the radio stations, Okumbe M.A. (2017) has done a study on  the three local radio stations of Kenya with the help of social responsibility theory. Researcher opined that, these radio stations have broken the monotony of English and Kiswahili languages and communicated programmes in nearby dialects. Listeners‘ cont ribution through phone -in based programmes is also enhancing this culture in the society. The researcher suggested that, the further study can be done on the reflection of the content upon the listeners, because radio stations are also responsible and acco untable for the social development of the society.   The success of the FM radio channels has brought an exclusive change in speech style among the Bangladeshi youth
	.  Ahmed  S. and Tinny  F. Z. (2013) studied this new phenomenon of the speech style using by the RJs and the listeners. The study pointed out the significant feature that, the RJs are using inter and intra -sentential code mixing/switching by mixing the language of Hindi, English and Bangla . The reason is that, RJs are being influenced by the new l anguage pattern of the young generation to some extent. They adopted this mix language pattern so that their listeners could feel connected with them. Further, this study argues that with the adoption of this phenomenon of language, the young 
	 160 generation is  creating a subculture among themselves.    Vijayakumar N. (2014)  came up with an evaluative study about the listening pattern of FM radio users according to the language and content of the programmes in Mysore district. Descriptive statistics were used to  analyze the collected data. The study mentions that , the younger generation is more inclined towards private radio stations and preferred to listen to it more frequently. While the old/aged audience still finds charm in listening to Vivid Bharati station,  probably because of their old connection to its programmes since their young age and they do not identify themselves with the content and language of the private/commercial FM radio channels.  FM radio stations can influence to its listeners in worldwide a reas, so researcher recommended that, FM radio stations may work on redesigning the programming format and convert into an overall family entertainment medium so that its reach can also be enhanced.   In a study conducted by Dey A. and Pascale F. (2014) throws light on the fact that the most  regular  types  of code -switchingisintra -sententialand inter -sentential, which are being used in the communication. They investigated the rules and constraints of code-switching in Hindi -English mixed language data and explained the various reasons for the same. The majority of the Hindi speakers generally tend to turn toEnglish,  because  it is simpler  to use the code-switching  with EnglishwordcomparedtoHindicounterpart .Theothermostpopularreasonfor  switching  to English is to define  the explanations,  as it is sometimes simpler  to understand  the notion  in English than  in   Hindi and also whenever there is no well -known Hindi word for an English word. The study also pointed  out that code switching occurs unintentionally as it has become a part of the speaking habit.   With this view, the language contact is an important phenomenon in the society, Barnali C. (2017) done an empirical study on the code -mixing/switching and found  that it has changed the meaning of communication in India.  In terms of radio, the researcher found that, radio jockey purposely blend English words with Hindi sentences to sound more funky and trendy . The researcher recommended that, this code mixing & switching trend have set up themselves as the most widely used language in the Hindi speaking states. In a multilingual country like India code -mixing and switching has become a norm rather than a deviation.   To examine the code mixing language pattern of the public and private radio stations in the Kohlapur city of Maharashtra, Tashi K. And Karekatti T. (2019)analyzed the recorded data of the radio stations. On the basis of the talking data of the RJs, it is f ound that,code -mixing takes place more in the programmes broadcasted by Radio Mirchi & Tomato FM and much less on Prasarbharati channel. Researcher opined that, wheneverjockeysorannouncers  are unable  to recollect  a suitablewordinMarathilanguage,they combin e Englishwords as common people do in their daily conversation.     In the view of the study of the related literature, content analysis methodology has applied in this paper to accomplish the desired result.    OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY  • To analyze the usage  of differentlanguages by private radio stations located at various places.  • To study the variety of content of programmes broadcasted by private radio stations.  • To understand the social linguistic approach in code -mixing/switching used by private FM radio stations.   RESEARCH METHODOLOGY  In this study, for analyzing the selected radio stations‘ content, the researcher conducted qualitative research  and applied content analysis technique for describing the data. Content Analysis is described as the scientific study of the content of communication.  Kerlinger (1986) defined content analysis as a method of studying and analyzing communication in a systematic, objective and quantitative manner for the purpose of meas uring variables
	. According to Weber (1985), content analysis is a research methodology that utilizes a set of procedures to make valid inferences from text. These inferences are about the sender(s) of the message, the message itself, or the audience of message. In this study, the data of three 
	 161 private radio stations were selected and analyzed on various parameters. These radio stations are from 3 different areas such as Ishq FM from New Delhi, Big FM from Chandigarh and Radio City from Karnal.   One week pr ogramme of the each radio station is the sample size for the content analysis. From morning time band show Ishq FM of New Delhi and Radio City of Karnal was taken. In the evening time band show, Big FM of Chandigarh was in the sample.   The researcher sele cted the morning and evening time band shows for the study because both time band shows are considered as drive time shows and has a highest listenership.  In this research, content analysis technique has applied for analyzing many recorded words and senten ces into different content categories based on explicit rule of coding. First of all, the researcher recorded the selected aired contentmeans radio shows and then it was analyzed. Self -observations were also conducted in order to support the significance of  the result.   DATA ANALYSIS  The researcher listened to the recorded audio files in the Sound Forge software and identified the RJs‘ and callers/guests‘ talking content so that the ‗links‘ can be analyzed in depth. In this section, the Hindi words and sentences are mark ed in italic font.   This table evident that, tentative a total of 50 hours of aired radio shows/programmes‘ content were recorded from  three radio stations . A total of 6 hours, 43 minutes and 47 seconds of content of RJs‘ links was identified, which was analyzed on various parameters. One syndicate show of Big FM is also included in the study, which was broadcasted in many stations simultaneously.

The maximum Intra sentential code -mixing is done by the RJ of BIG FM. However, Radio City is at number two by using 190 words in one week under intra sentential code -mixing category and then f ollowed by Ishq FM comprises 105 words in a week for the same category. Thereafter, in inter sentential code -mixing type; RJ of Ishq FM has done code -mixing in 130 sentences, whereas, RJ of BIG FM just limited herself on 10 sentences, which are a huge diff erence. In fact, RJ of Radio City has used only 8 sentences in his show. One more category called intra word switching is being used by RJ of Radio City only.

However, Ishq FM is on the second position by utilizing 30 words i n a single week and afterward pursued by Radio City contains 25 words in a single week for a similar classification. From there on, in inter sentential code -mixing type, callers/guest on Ishq FM used code -mixing in 65 sentences though callers/guest of BIG FM used 60 sentences. Callers/guest of Radio City simply constrained themselves on 10 sentences which is an enormous contrast. Intra word switching is not utilized by any caller.

Finding and conclusion  The study was conducted to identify the language pattern  of the private FM radio stations and variation in the content of the programme. The study concludes that, RJs are presenting programmes in a language, which they feel is appropriate according to the topic and the target listeners. It is also observed that, RJs are utilizing full range and assortment of words and sentences of different languages in their presentation. Usage of Code mixing language pattern is a natural mode of speaking in private FM radio programmes. But it is also found that, this pattern is free from the standard norms and rules of the any particular language . Even listeners are also decoding this code mixing pattern and using it during the conversation with the RJs. By doing this, RJs and listeners are trying to cre ate and maintain a strong association between them. The paper argues that, the primary objective of the usage of this code -mixing pattern is to express the particular topic, so that listeners can understand in a better way. Another objective is to attract and enhance the listenership of the radio station.   The study also reveals that, RJs of these radio stations are using this code -mixing/switching language pattern a lot in their communication, ether it is inter sentential code -mixing or intra sentential code -mixing. Different words from regional languages are also being used by the RJs. Several English words are so frequent in Hindi that they have become a part of Hindi language .   In terms of content, the study concludes that, commercial FM radio stations are providing the content variation in their programmes. The content and presenta tion of the every 
	 165 programme is entirely different from each other. Private FM radio stations have created programme names, segments and other station utilities based on such words and languages which are targeting the young listeners. The content of these programmes of Radio City, Big FM and Ishq FM is mainly based on the various segments related tosocial issues,current affairs and phone -in conversation. Bollowood actress Vidya Balan hosted the show ‗ Dhun Badal ke toh Dekho ‘on Big FM and picks up the issue pertaining to society and trending social problems and tries to come up with a solution of such issues. This show comprises various segments such as ‗Reporter kaviraj‘ in which topic of the show used to be described in a poetic way by one poet. The show ha s another section in which viewpoints/opinions from famous bollywood celebrities and other listeners were also included. The show broadcasted by Ishq FM has two phone -in contests named ‗Battle of sexes‘ and ‗Youbet‘ in which listeners participated and got a chance to win the exciting prizes on -air.   RJ also describes brief description about any one word in the show as ‗word of the day segment.‘ In the programme of Radio City, RJ conveyed the traffic update, city update and weather update to inform the listeners. The content of this show is based on th e current happenings related to International, National, Regional and local. RJ also included one phone -in contest, which was related to films. A part of phone -in, RJ played the vox -pop bytes from common people based on the various social issues. RJs are c ommunicating in casual style, formal style and consultative style according to the content and target listeners of their programmes.   LIMITATION AND FURTHER SCOPE OF THE STUDY  There are certain limitations in this study. The present study has been conduct ed only from the 3 private radio channels of 3 Hindi belt cities - New Delhi, Chandigarh and Karnal. Therefore, we are not sure whether these results could be generalized to the other part of the Hindi belt cities. Due to the time constraints, it was not possible to take 24 hours content of the each radio, so only one time band show of each radio station was analyzed. The other time band shows must have some other different content of the programme. Hence, the study further can be extended by taking other pr ogrammes of different private radio stations from other cities. Another area is that, to find out the more reasons of using code -mixing or code -switching for further research.   REFERENCES  Ahmed  S. and Tinny  F. Z.

Governments have to make hard decisions which result in students are having a hard time studying. They have to stay and study at home. Not all schools are ready for online school  as the tools or systems are not ready. Fortunately, Vedantu and RuangGuru as education platforms based on mobile applications and computers give free access to students in times of COVID -19. Through this research the authors find many ideations come up ba ck and forth through the process from the decision which the governments made until solutions come from the support of Vedantu and RuangGuru application. In this journal, the authors try to compare two news reported by NewIndianExpress.com  and JakartaGlobe .id where the authors find three parts of news that have similar ideations and the three categories which in part of ideation (cognitive, emotional, social). To analyze the news the authors use Mayring methodology as the tools to analyze textual content an d ideations as the theory to compare between the two news. There are three similarities being compared between India and Indonesia. Firstly, the governments‘ policy to prevent the spread COVID -19 where they want to establish beliefs, values, and self -image  through cognitive categories, Secondly Decision making to close the school and start online learning which is not well -prepared as their emotional category involved to bring self-efficacy and responses, Lastly Vedantu and Ruangguru come to support and inf luence (Social category).   Keywords: Ideations, Mayring, Vedantu, RuangGuru, COVID -19.  INTRODUCTION  Education International organization tracks the country -wide school closures in 188 countries with 1,576,021,818 learners are impacted, and 63,000,000 are affected. The pandemic COVID -19 creates problems in the world of education, such as, students and teachers are not able to go school like it used to be, schools have to find a way out to ensure students are still able to study and teachers are also able to teach in the midst of this outbreak.  While Education contributes to people's life meaning, the education system creates future 
	 168 adults who can give good contributions to their own country in the future. Thus, it is a disaster i f education stops, and people are not able to study or learn any longer (Schinkel et al., 2015). This might happen now since the pandemic COVID -19, where some countries are having a hard time to go to school as most of the governments try to prevent the sp read towards home quarantine (Asquith, 2020).        In history, there are many significant disease outbreaks and pandemics recorded, for instance, Spanish Flu, Hong Kong Flu, SARS, H7N9, Ebola, Zika. Influenza pandemics have struck three times every century since 1500.  Pandemic refers to a widespread epide mic of the contagious disease the whole of a country or one or more continents face at the same time. The term has not been defined (Qiu et al., 2017).   Schwartz et al. (2010:722) wrote about Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) which spread 5 contine nts with thousands of cases, hundreds of deaths caused by SARS. Thus people were asked to self -quarantined and restricted to travel. At the same time, online shopping had a role to fulfill the crisis. At that time online shopping contributed to preventing infection or the spread of SARS which dramatically changed consumer behavior on how they shop in the future (Forster & Tang, 2005).   Li et al. (2014:2) also wrote about the Avian Influenza (AI) outbreak in China where the virus was derived from poultry and  there was no indication on the avian when it is infected by the virus, thus, people are hard to identify. Then, social media was used in public health surveillance to facilitate interpersonal communication to share regarding monitoring on AI outbreak. It became a global phenomenon as a communication tool to disseminate disease risks and interventions and to promote a healthy lifestyle and policy in 2014 (Fung et al., 2015).

In this study during the break of COVID -19, the authors will observe how educational platforms based on technology are used to help people who are quarantined still able to study online as a revolutionary breakthrough to help the government  in stopping the spread of COVID -19.  Moreover, Schools are temporarily closed in many regions in Indonesia, in an attempt to prevent the spread of COVID -19 (Nugroho, 2020). Simultaneously, many schools are also closed in India to prevent the spread of COV ID-19 (NewIndianExpress.com, 2020). In other words, Indonesia and India also have the same problems in education where the world now faces.   Technological developments in the 21st century directly change people's lives (Singh, 2019). Technology capability  also changes the culture of people's lives from closed to public consumption (Sachdeva & Tripathi, 2019).   Nevertheless, Educational platforms based in technology become a trend in Indonesia and India during the outbreak. Reported by Jakarta 
	 169 Post, RuangG uru as an education application gives open access to students who are in need to study (Editor, 2020b). At the same time, NewIndianExpress.com reports Vedantu offers online learning with no cost for who is also in need to study in the times of COVID -19 (Editor, 2020c).   Through media representation, RuangGuru and Vedantu being highlighted. People are more noticed in the applications. It shows that media is a powerful tool to bring something into society or community (Govender, 2014).  This study looks at how  the online media newindianexpress.com and jakartaglobe.id is raising the contribution of education application amid the COVID -19 pandemic. This study also uses qualitative content analysis as a research method and Ideation as a theory to find related issu es brought by Vedantu and RuangGuru as an educational platform.   LITERATURE REVIEW  Ideation is a process to help people to develop truly original ideas in order to develop the right solution. In other words, ideation is all about brainstorming of many idea s as we can (Rgovic et al., 2013). There are two aspects which are related. They are social interaction and a new way of thinking. Ideation is all about innovation where a new way thinking are shared within a social system (Kincaid, 2015).    Figure 3 Idea tion Process  (Source: Gode, 2019)   The model (figure 3) shows that all the component affects the intermediate outcome. It determined the behavior changes. Moreover, there are three categories in ideation cognitive, emotional, and social which address different output in every category where are related to the discuss ion. Firstly, Cognitive is a risk perception where an individual‘s beliefs, values, and attitudes are addressed. Subjective norms mean what an individual perceives and what others should do. Social norms are related to what an individual thinks others are doing. Lastly, the individual thinks about himself (self -image). All the components are in the cognitive category. Second, Emotional is how an individual feels about the new behaviors either it is positive or negative and how the behavior can be performed (self-efficacy). Lastly, Social factors consist of interpersonal interaction to convince someone to behave in a certain way to adopt the new behavior when an individual can ensure someone to adopt the new behavior is called personal advocacy (Babalola et a l., 2016).   Ideation can be improved when it is brainstormed. Brainstorming creates many ideas to get the synthesis to build on each other ideas rather than one person‘s idea. The better quality of ideation comes up when people refrained from criticizing o ne another‘s ideas. Thus, it is important to have a large number of ideas. In other words, the more ideas people generate the more good ideas will be produced (Briggs & Reinig, 2007).   In other words, Ideation is a collaborative way of looking at social i ssues through putting creative ideas on the table communicating those ideas, challenging those ideas all process that leads to landing what the real question we want to ask ourselves about what the real issue is. The process makes us understand what ideati on is and its focus on solution orientation (Hay et al., 2019). While the ideation‘s process is going through, there seem questions back and forth but they are related to the real question and what focuses on the topic. Furthermore, we never know what is right, but through ideation, we get a chance to get it right. Through ideation, it opens creativity and inspiration to get brainstorming as many as we can and grouped the ideas. So that, we can well -organized many ideas into a clear concept (Gode, 2019).   This theory fits and contributes to the topic of the field where the authors will analyze how governments‘ decision regarding online education creates many ideations which are related to two categories of ideation (cognitive -emotional, and social) and to se e how the process creates new intention and 
	
	 170 new behavior of online schooling, also, Vedantu and RuangGuru as a support platform which actualizes the new behavior or intention.   METHODOLOGY  This research uses a qualitative analysis content method (Fong & Nyathi, 2019). The object of this study consists of two news articles, representing two countries India and Indonesia. The first news article came from newindianexpress.com entitled "Education in the times of COVID -19 and how to keep up with studies" and t he second news article came from jakartaglobe.id titled "Cities Turn to Online Learning to Prevent COVID -19 Spreading Among Students". This research will use the Mayring content analysis method.  The mass media where the authors choose is e -news. Mass media  means to deliver messages or information to a large group of people where people can access anytime to receive what they are looking for (Kholik, 2015). Thus, the two news where the authors have taken, are from NewIndianExpress.com and JakartaGlobe. Id.   The two news articles through several criteria, such as an online media platform on a national scale, and exposure to international audiences, as well as continuing updates on the development of the COVID -19 pandemic in each country, were selected. The edu cation segment was specifically chosen because it is one of the most important sectors affected, thus, encouraging all students to carry out learning activities at home using an internet service connection.   Khiang, Ahmad, Ibrahim, and Kee (2012:22) explai ned that framing as a way to evaluate evaluative perceptions, as it is considered by Mustaffa and Ibrahim (2018:171), the media can provide prominent information or problems on the mind of audiences. Therefore, the news becomes manipulative because it aims  to dominate the subject's existence as something legal, objective, natural, and inevitable (Satriani, 2018:250).Also, (Priyo Sadono & Fensi, 2015) describe framing as a tool to analyze a phenomenon to construct reality. Where the media has their way to deliver the news and how they stress in one particular issue with their framing (Marta et al., 2019). Categorization will be carried out before the research begins, so this study uses induction formation in qualitative content analysis. This categorization i s formed from the formulation of research questions which will be followed by theoretical and conceptual frameworks.   Mayring has developed a sequential analysis of qualitative content and proposed three analytical procedures that can be carried out both independently and in combination, depending on specific research questions. The three things mentioned above (Marta & Rieuwpassa, 2018) include abstraction, application, and structuration.   Abstraction is an attempt to reduce the material in such a way tha t only important content is retained. A collection of texts can be managed properly through abstractions that do not eliminate the essence of the original material. The text is paraphrased, then tries to be generalized to be abstracted and reduced. The tex t abstraction treatment forms a paraphrase of the message contained in newsindianexpress.com and jakartaglobe.id news content about the role of Vedantu and RuangGuru online application in the success of online learning in the general period during the COVI D-19 pandemic.   Vedantu is an online tutoring platform to provide interactive online learning systems. Vedantu uses a real -time virtual learning environment named Whiteboard Audio Video Environment where students can study, browse, and discover what they want to learn. It was founded in 2011 by Vamsi Krishna, Pulkit Jain, Saurabh Saxena, and Anand Prakash. Vedantu itself means Veda: ‗knowledge‘ Tantu: Network, thus, the founders hope a knowledge network where any student can tap into a teacher directly and  learning can happen in a personalized way, anytime -anywhere (Source: Vedantu.com/v/about -us)

	 171 RuangGuru was founded by Adamas Belva Syah and Muhammad Iman Usman 2014. RuangGuru provides various tutor online systems, for instance, private class, virtual classroom, online exam, etc. RuangGuru is in cooperation with 32 out of 34 provinces in Indonesia to support online learning. 15 million students have experienced to use RuangGuru .          Questions raised through unit analysis are examined by qualitative content analysis in online media. The author's implications are based on adequate literary quotations, can form a glossary, or comprise footnotes. In the first step, the lexico -grammatical resolution is traced from the use or choice of vocabulary (lexicon) and structuring of the language used (grammatical). Both of these things have been determined, then exploration material is determined followed by boundary analysis and broad context analy sis.   Structure following procedures is used in classical content analysis which is often seen as the most crucial content analysis technique. The goal is to filter out certain structures of material because texts are generally structured according to spe cific contents, shapes, and scales. The first stage is the determination of the unit of analysis, after which the dimension of structuring will be formed based on a theoretical framework as the basis for a predefined data categorization system. This resear ch uses Ideation theory to describe the news..   DISCUSSION  There are two articles from e -newspapers related to education in times of Covid -19. The e-newspapers which the authors would like to analyze are NewIndianExpress.com and JakartaGlobe.id. The author s would like to compare and find the similarities between those two articles. The authors also relate the ideation theory with the Mayring method to find the same ideas or brainstorming on those two articles. The two news is divided into three parts which have different categories of ideation which are cognitive, emotional, and social. The two news are listed below (figure 6 and figure 7).   The abstraction process can be seen in the news when the government made policies to dismiss all students affected, this situation is used by various learning service providers through the online application to the selling point of the product. So that online learning has the value of substitution in the process of conventional learning towards online learning .  Figure  6 NewIndianExpress.com   The newsindianexpress.com news quote shows that the government has the same beliefs, values, perceived risks, and subjective norms that prevent COVID -19. Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke to the public on March 19 to maintain soci al distance and provide online education for students who are required to stay at home. The value of trust between the government and various online learning service providers is also conveyed to assist students in using a good platform. It was written tha t responding from various platforms also supported positively as did the British Council language learning institutions.   ―Following the outbreak of COVID -19 in the country, many schools and other educational institutions have stalled their classes. Even before Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the nation on March 19 to maintain social distancing, a lot of students had al ready confined themselves to their homes. ..‖ (Source : NewIndianExpress.com)   The online media of jakartaglobe.id writes about the decisiveness of several local governments in Indonesia. One of them is the Figure 5RuangGuru  Logo  Source: https:// RuangGuru .com/general/about  
	 172 Bogor city government, represented by Fahkrudin as  head of the education service, urging people to stay at home to reduce the spread of COVID -19. In this case, Modi and Fahkrudin have actions against subjective norms that give them direction to order their people to remain at home.   Fahkrudin, the head of  Bogor's education department, said at the moment the city faced difficulty with providing adequate face masks and antiseptic liquid for the schools.  "Prevention protocols dictate we must provide protective equipment at the schools. But this time, it is still difficult to obtain,"  Fahkrudin said.  (Source JakartaGlobe.id)    Figure 7 JakartaGlobe.id   The news on newindianexpress.com and jakartaglobe.id shows the emphasis on subjective norms on society. Subjective norms are a belief which most of the people will approve of someone‘s decision. The belief is determined by social pressure, thus, all individuals will act in the same actions or certain manner (Ham et al., 2016). As their subjective norms relate to the social pressure which they have made decisions  to reduce perceived risks, thus, the belief and the decisions which they make are the best solutions for all.   The content application in the news newindianexpress.com and jakartaglobe.id is seen in the presence of Vedantu and RuangGuru application as a representation amidst various start -ups in the globalization era, which were initially used as an alternative, me ans to support learning but succeeded in increasing confidence to take the government to assist in the education sector during the pandemic COVID -19. Belief means acceptance of someone‘s decision or how we apprehend and discuss the reality that can be trac ed through the historical development of academic discourse (Motz, 2014). In this situation, Modi and Fahkrudin believe their people will accept their decisions or policy to limit activities outside included school activity.   Lastly, it comes out with a c ertain value that the decision that Modi and Fahkrudin have decided is important and it is the way to act in this situation of Pandemic COVID -19. Eventually, it converts to a self -image that Modi and Fahkrudin have the ability to lead their people against COVID -19. Amid social distancing policy, Narendra Modi and Fahkrudin still give a good solution in education problems where they provide Vedantu and RuangGuru as tools to learn online. Amid social distancing policies, Modi and Fahkrudin still provide good solutions to educational problems where they provide Vedantu and RuangGuru as a tool for online learning.   ―The  spread of COVID -19 has forced many educational institutions across the globe to close campuses. India has over 37 million students enrolled in h igher education. An interruption in the delivery of education could cause long term disruption. Thepandemic requires universities to rapidly offer online learning to their students. ..‖ says Raghav Gupta, Managing Director (India and APAC), Coursera. ‖ (Source : NewIndianExpress.com)   The Emotional Concept in Ideation explains how emotions can be responded to and so becomes empathy. The Newsindianexpress.com framing takes a perspective on the ability of Indian universities to use technology. So that tech nology, in this case, can improve the quality of empathy of policyholders in making quick decisions during the COVID -19 pandemic. This reinforces McLuhan's idea of the Global Village concept of how humans are encouraged to be able to connect fully in the d igital age so that it becomes a challenge for other countries that are not yet capable of developing to move quickly.   
	 173 ―In West Java, Indonesia's  most populous province with 49 million people,  students would also study at home for two weeks, Governor Ridwa n Kamil said on Sunday. "Students will be able to receive instruction from  their teacher  remotely using an online system," Ridwan said. .. Meanwhile, Central Java Governor Ganjar Pranowo said on Saturday that the province suspended teaching activities at al l levels of educations, except for those who would be facing the final exam next week.   "Those who are not taking exams, will not go to schools and should take an online course," Ganjar said. (Source : JakartaGlobe.id)    Indonesia as a broad country is a challenge where decisions must be centralized responded with various regional studies (Fernando et al, 2019). So the empathy produced depends on each regional head. The media of jakartaglobe.id provides a different perspective by raising several provinces with an indication of the spread of the highest cases. The Governor of Banten, West Java, and East Java have the same empathy to stop all offline educational activities and go online by promoting humanity even though on one side of education technology is inadequate.   Framing the media in India and Indonesia, explained the figure of leadership has similar efficacy in which they believe students can still study at home with online education. Meanwhile, it creates an emotional response, since, some schools‘ o nline system is not ready for this situation in India (Banchariya Sheetal And, 2020) even so in Indonesia (Angdhiri, 2020). Governments have to make quick decisions through this outbreak since the virus is rapidly spreading. As a result, not all decisions can be applied, ideally. During the outbreak, there is ideation back and forth which is related to the emotional category where self -efficacy and emotional response is being created.   Social concepts talk about support and influence, and the ability to ca rry out personal advocacy. The rapid reaction issued by online learning service providers actually helped the government through quick decisions made regarding several schools not ready to do so. Vedantu, as an online learning application provides free onl ine schooling during the COVID -19 pandemic in India (Editor, 2020a). The news of newindianexpress.com covers the whole statement of Vanmsi Krisha as CEO of the Vedantu application which supports and collaborates with the Indian state to provide online guid ance during the pandemic.   ―We also support and cooperate with state and national government authorities to put all necessary measures in place to ensure the continued well -being of all. .. ―At Vedantu, we believe that the best quality of education should b e accessible to everyone, anytime. We believe online learning is a safe option in these risky and uncertain times. The students can study from the safety of their home and avoid travel to public places. We are closely monitoring the impact of COVID -19 and are here to assist students and schools with all their learning needs. ‖ (Source: NewIndianExpress.com)   In this situation, Vedantu and RuangGuru have given support and influence to society. Where online learning before COVID -19 was only alternation or sec ondary method, now, it becomes the main method where it can help to prevent the spread of pandemic COVID -19. The news on jakartaglobe.id also frames the RuangGuru appellation which shows support and advocacy that provides free online classes. RuangGuru sup ports the majority of users to provide free internet access, in collaboration with one of the largest telecommunications providers in Indonesia, Telkomsel (Fach, 2020).    ―RuangGuru, an Indonesian online learning platform, announced on Saturday that it wou ld open access to its interactive online courses  for free to all students in Indonesia. Starting on Monday, the live course sessions would be available from 08:00 a
	.m. to 12:00 p.m. every day, said Belva Devara, RuangGuru's co -founder and chief executive in a video announcement. ‖ (Source: JakartaGlobe)‖   The Pandemic COVID -19 has risen ideations in education. Through governments‘ decision to close schools the government tries to replace the offline class into an online class. However, there are problems through the limitations of technology or tools. Fortunately, Vedantu and RuangGuru as educational 
	 174 platforms provide free online classes amid the outbreak. They support the government to keep students in India and Indonesia learning in times of COVID -19. In  a time of the pandemic, technologies have empowered citizens to form transportation for advancing concern where this situation linked to human rights, ecology, and development (Narula, 2012). Moreover, Vedantu and Ruangguru are technology that is easy to use. It would lead to an era where people are more knowledgeable and to improve all decisions (Kabha et al., 2019).   CONCLUSION  Governments‘ temporary policies in India and Indonesia such as social distancing and close schools‘ activities create many ideations as a theory in this journal.  The theory explains how cognitive and emotional are involved in creating ideations. Cognitive ly, the governments give policies to prevent the spread, however, in case of schools‘ activities being stopped its emotional factor is not supported by the system in India neither in Indonesia, but Vedantu and RuangGuru support to provide online learning i n a time of COVID -19. It implies that technology can help society when they are restricted to do activities outside in the time of Pandemic. Companies could see this as

At times when the geographic boundaries have become blurred due to the virtual connectivity and ad vancement in internet technology, South Korean popular culture is developing at an unprecedented rate across the globe. The popularity is such that it has entered the mainstream even competing with the Hollywood films, dramas and music. The field of Hallyu  though has attracted many from the academia, as it is still a newer research area, not many significant attempts have been made to review the literature in a systematic manner. The major objective of this paper is to acquire a better understanding, and a detailed review of the research regarding Hallyu wave, its allied areas, current status and trends. Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is the method used for this paper. This research has utilized the methods presented by Junior & Filho (2010), Jabbour (20 13) and Seuring (2013). The researchers have deployed a systematic literature review approach to collect, analyze and synthesize data regarding the Hallyu wave, addressing a variety of topics using Google Scholar between 2000 and 2019 and selected 100 prim ary research articles. From the systematic literature review, the results or main gaps from the existing literature have been uncovered. For example: most of the low income countries do not have extensive research on Hallyu or most of the research on Hally u is done in the region of East Asia and Pacific.   Keywords : Hallyu Wave, Korean Popular Culture, Cultural Hybridity, Cultural Diplomacy, Cultural Proximity .  INTRODUCTION  With over two decades of the evolution of Hallyu wave which can be roughly described as the spread of the Korean popular culture and media throughout the globe, the phenomenon of Hallyu wave has been successful in grasping the attention of academicians all over the world (Lyan, 2019; Masood & Rahim, 2020; Mustikawati, 2020; Ravina, 2009; Yoon, 2020). It is the powerful impact of Hallyu wave that has contributed to the growth of Korean economy and eventually created a positive image of Korea in the world (Elaskary, 2018; Lee, 2020; Kim,  2014; Sung, 2010).   There are numerous reasons that have facilitated the rise of Hallyu. According to Yin & Liew (2005), the economic growth of Korea, Korea‘s history of decolonization and the reassurance of Asian identity that came out as a response of s ocial and cultural hegemony of the West caused the growth of Hallyu. Also the financial crisis of 1997 played a crucial part in expanding Hallyu as its aftermath led Korea to explore new export markets (Cho, 2005; Elfving -Hwang, 2013; Kim, 2007; Shim 2006) . Undeniably, the role of South Korean government is very significant in popularising Hallyu.   As an outcome of the government‘s policies that provided opportunities to the domestic cultural industries, the Korean pop culture began to flourish (Korean Center for Information Services [ KOCIS], 2013). Be it the establishment of Korean Culture Centers in every corner of the world or promoting Korea as a tourist hotspot via publicizing the locations of popular drama sets or providing 
	   178 incentives on the purchase of Korean goods in form of Korean pop culture, the role of government is noteworthy (Trolan, 2017; Walsh, 2014). Let‘s discuss the meaning of Hallyu.    Defining Hallyu Wave:  Evolving in the late 1990s, the spread of Korean popular culture (Hallyu) in China, Japan and rest of East Asia met with an unprecedented success. The dramas like ―What is love‖; ―Winter Sonata‖ became very popular and grabbed the attention of the locals in China and Japan. This drama craze soon spread like fire across a major part of Asia and even in far off places like Middle East and Europe. Later on K -pop spearheaded this phenomenon accompanied by advancement in technology and advent of social media and  networking in the late 2000s. It has to be noted that K -movies were simultaneously enjoyed by the general public of Korea and other nations after the government opened up the markets and provided more opportunities and less stringent rules of film making to the film makers.   Today the word Hallyu means anything that is Korean ranging from Korean popular culture products such as drama, music, movies, to food, cosmetics, games, animations etc. It would not be wrong to say that Hallyu is a cultural tsunami t hat has swept across the world (Dator & Seo, 2004; Endo & Matsumoto, 2004; Hanaki et al., 2007; Ji -eun, 2005; Tachasakulmas, 2011 ).Therefore Hallyu has been defined in numerous ways.   In fact, Hallyu is a term applicable only when the popular cultural prod ucts are exposed to the audiences outside Korea. Chua states that Hallyu content is mostly foreign to its audience (as cited in Lyan & Lev kowitz, 2015) . The popular cultural products fall under the category of Hallyu only when the products are exported to other countries and are successful irrespective of their popularity and reception within Korea (Kim, 2007).   According to Choi (2015), Hallyu covers multiple cultural domains as it include essential content (K -drama, K -pop), semi -essential content (videogame, food), para Hallyu products and services (tourism, cosmetic products, plastic surgery, fashion items and language services), distri bution channels (various communication technologies) and effects (sale of commodities and national image. He further uses the term, Hallyu -hwa (literally meaning Hallyu -ize) to highlight the contribution and urge of both the producers and customers to popu larize Hallyu.    Different scholars have categorized Hallyu in numerous ways. It has been groupedas Hallyu wave or Neo -Hallyu wave. Jin (2016) classified Hallyu into two phases as Hallyu 1.0 that extended from 1990s to 2007 and Hallyu 2.0 as the phase fro m 2007 to the present day. The second Hallyu wave has included not only Korean pop cultural products but also products like digital games, cosmetics, plastic surgery etc.   The period of Hallyu wave from 1990s -2007 witnessed the advancement in technology, smartphone revolution and advent of social media networking which enabled the fans to enjoy the Korean pop cultural products throughout the world. Whereas the present day Hallyu is the era of Neo - Hallyu where many new dimensions have been added like cosme tics, aesthetics and plastic surgery. Hallyu can be dissected into four parts: Hallyu 1.0 led by K -dramas, Hallyu 2.0 led by K -pop music, Hallyu 3.0 led by K -culture and finally Hallyu 4.0 led by K -style (Bok -rae, 2015).    Today with the K -pop bands like BTS, BLACKPINK, MAMAMOO, TXT attracting millions of audiences around the world; Movies like Parasite, The Host and Train to Busan gaining critics attention; Korean food like Kimchi, Bibimbap, Bulgogi and drinks like Soju, Bokbunja ju being served in all co rners of the globe, the craze for Korean things is like never before. For the popularity of Korean things, the credit should be given to the fans and supranational fandoms that actively act as ambassadors and facilitators of Korean culture among their acqu aintances and thus play a crucial role in spreading the Hallyu wave (Bok -rae, 2015; Otmagzin & Lyan, 2014)
	. With all better things said of Hallyu, there are also instances where Hallyu is losing popularity and there are anti -Hallyu movements increasing in some countries (Ainslie et al., 2017; Chen, 2017; Ki -kim et al., 2014).   The aim of this article is to identify the variety of topics, subjects, and areas around which the 
	   179 research is being conducted across the world with regard to the Hallyu wave. For this purpose, the researchers carried out a systematic literature review. In  relation to the context, the major objective of the article is to analyse the literature to present the gaps in the area of Hallyu studies.   As the area of Hallyu research is relatively new, the Hallyu phenomenon is changing its form since its inception in 1990s that has led to evolution of newer dimensions of Hallyu. For example, in the initial phase Hallyu to a major extent was limited to Kor ean-drama, Korean -movies in countries in East Asia and South East Asia. However, after the advent of social media, internet and new media roughly after 2000, Hallyu wave has been continuously expanding to the places in Europe, North America, Middle East, L atin America and South Asia.   Moreover, there is the inclusion of K -pop music, cosmetics, animation, games, plastic surgery, tourism etc. in the present day Hallyu. Therefore, it necessitates the need for an effort that can consolidate the existing litera ture. Through the detailed enquiry into the literature using the technique of systematic literature review, the areas thoroughly studied, areas not paid much attention, and emerging areas have been recognised. This would certainly help the academicians, researchers to follow up with the research and allow them to identify trends, pointers of the Hallyu research. Thus, the literature limiting to 100 research articles from 2000 to 2019 in Google Scholar was selected for the study.   The structure of the artic le is described below. Firstly, a brief review of the main subjects addressed in the research articles included in the study. Secondly, the methods used for carrying out the literature review have been stated. Finally, the main results or gaps of the analy sis along with the conclusions and recommendations for future research are stated.   OBJECTIVES OF THE RESEARCH STUDY:  The objectives of the study are as follows:  1. To locate the countries and geographical regions where the research on Hallyu wave has expand ed. 2. Toexplore the key areas, subjects and sub -themesof the research around theHallyu discourse.  3. To identify the methods deployed for researching Hallyu and its dimensions.  4. To recognize the dominant theories those have served as the background for the Hally u research and studies.  Theoretical frame of reference  From the review of literature, the following theories are the ones primarily used:   Uses & gratifications approach: One of the classical theories of communicationUses & gratifications theory deals wit h what the audience does with the media. It was proposed by Elihu Katz, Jay Blumler and Gurevitch in 1973. This theory posits that the audiences‘ use of media is goal -directed and their goal is to satisfy their various needs. There are five types of needs that motivate people to seek media for gratification: Cognitive needs, Affective needs, Personal integrative needs, Social integrative needs, Tension release needs (Katz et al., 1973). This theory holds an important place in media studies due to the fact t hat with changing technologies there is also change in humans‘ habits of media usage (Mairaru et al., 2019). With reference to the consumption of Hallyu products, the various needs and media the audience uses is of significance, thus many researchers have utilized the Uses & gratifications approach (Alanzalon, 2011; Kato, 2013; Kwon, 2007; Millanyani & Pramiyanti 2015; Que, 2014).   Cultural Hybridity: One of the reasons, Hallyu appeals to the audiences throughout the world is the presence of the element of Hybridity. The interplay and blending between the local and global elements in a culture is the simplest explanation for cultural hybridity. Hybridization is significant as it is a useful concept for understanding and examining the influences of multiple c ultures (Wagner, 2012)
	.   For the audiences in Asia, the Hallyu cultural products such as K -dramas, K - movies and K -pop music provide them with a balanced mix of Asian values and western ideas. Therefore, hybridization leads to the sustenance of local iden tities in the global landscape (Shim, 2006). On the other hand, when the audiences 
	   180 outside Asia consume Hallyu products, in most cases, they are attracted towards the underrated and unknown Asian culture that is completely alien to them. Thus, the element of hybridity generates a curiosity towards the exotic Asian culture (Kim, 2018; Pramadya & Oktaviani, 2016; Yang, 2012).   Cultural Diplomacy/Soft power: The growth and success of Hallyu is facilitated by the use of soft power and cultural diplomacy of the government. Where one cannot win over the audiences throughout the world through the use of hard power such as military, war and authoritarian regime, the clever usage of soft power from the government side via diplomatic ways can influence the varied cultures hence people across the globe. Both these terms are intertwined with each other.   Cultural diplomacy a subset of public diplomacy can be described as ―an actor‘s attempt to manage the international environment through making its cultural resources and achievements known overseas and/or facilitating cultural transmission abroad‖ (Cull, 2008, p.33). On the other hand, Soft power refers to ―the ability to influence the behavior of others to get the outcomes one wants through attraction rather than coer cion‖ (Nye, 2004, p. 2). Thus in case of Hallyu, it is the Korean government‘s policies and to win the hearts of public through its pop culture comes under cultural diplomacy where soft power is a tool to improve the country‘s image in other countries (Ain slie, 2016; Jang & Paik, 2012; Kim et al., 2016).   Audience/ Reception Analysis - Stuart Hall’s encoding decoding: The idea behind audience reception analysis is to understand how the audience receives the media i.e. what happens when the audience encounters  a media text. Taking into consideration of the active nature of the audience, the reception analysis framework focus on the ways audience constructs meanings out of the media texts. As per Stuart Hall (1973), there are three categorizations of readings of  a media (Television) text:  Dominant or preferred readings are produced when viewers who fully believe in whatever is displayed on television meaning that the viewers get the intended message the television apparatus (producers, directors, and scriptwriter s) wanted to convey.  Negotiated readings are produced when viewers add their personal interpretation of the content that differs from the preferred reading in important ways but not completely. Oppositional readings are produced by the viewers when they d evelop interpretations of content which are directly opposition to the dominant reading of the text. Thus, there are also attempts from the side of the researchers to check the audience interpretation of the Korean pop cultural products ( Briandana & Ibrahi m, 2015; Espiritu, 2011; Ruslan & Latif, 2016).   Cultural proximity: Joseph D. Straubhaar proposed the cultural proximity theory in 1991. This theory states that audiences are more likely to select products from their own culture or from countries similar to theirs. The audience opts for the local media content because of t he identifiable cultural content and language. If the local media is unable to deliver the content desired by the audience, they would prefer a country that‘s proximate to their native country in terms of the language, culture, and geography. Straubhaar argues that it is due to the presence of a certain set of cultural offerings that audience experience cultural proximity and identify with the media content. These can include language, customs, ethnic appearances, values (Straubhaar, 1991).   The commonalit ies and familiarity that Hallyu products share with the culture of the countries of reception is one of the significant forces for the success of Hallyu especially in East Asia and South East Asia (Ho, 2013). The common values shared across the Asian regio n allows for the easier dissemination of Hallyu products as the audiences can understand the meaning of certain traditions, systems and norms followed in the society
	. Often Korean dramas and movies have plot, storyline that make a reference to Confucianism , a faith system followed in China, Taiwan and other parts of East Asia. The themes of filial piety, family system and traditions related to Confucianism in the Korean popular culture is a major factor for the success of Hallyu (Ryoo, 2009).   Cultural disc ount: Colin Hoskins and Rolf Mirus introduced the Cultural Discount theory in 1988. The theory states that the cultural distinctiveness of a country‘s cultural products 
	   181 in terms of styles, values, beliefs, institutions and behavioral patterns might hinder the acceptance of cultural products in other countries. This means that larger the cultural distance between the imported media products and audience, less likely the audience is to develop a connection with the media products.   It further throws light on  how cultural products when exported to a foreign country lose its appeal owing to the differences between the country of origin and country of reception and audiences‘ inability to identify with the norms and values portrayed in the cultural products (Hos kins & Mirus, 1988). It means that the media products with low cultural discount would be able to penetrate the foreign markets more easily than the media products with high cultural discount. Thus there is a probability that Hallyu products have low cultu ral discount than its counterparts. This has generated a lot of interest in the researchers to explore the relationship between Hallyu‘s success and cultural discount (Sora, 2004; Yang, 2012).   Media Dependency: In 1976, American communications researchers , Sandra Ball -Rokeach and Melvin De Fleur developed the media dependency theory. This theory focuses on the relationship between the media and the audiences. It states that individuals tend to develop a dependency on the media, which is capable of meeting various needs. The two major propositions of the theory include 1. Greater the number of social functions performed by the media greater will be the audience dependency on the media; 2. In times of social conflict and change, the audience dependence on the  media increases thus the media‘s effect on the audiences will also increase (Ball -Rokeach & De Fleur, 1976). Thus there are chances where the audiences might develop a dependency on the Korean media products (Cabello, 2018; Utami, 2019).   Cultivation Anal ysis: Cultivation theory / Cultivation Analysis was proposed by George Gerbner. This theory argues that media especially television presents exaggerated and unreal images, as a result of which people perceive the real world through television‘s perspective . They think of the world as displayed on the television.   As television offers many ideas, the continuing consumption of television over a long time cultivates specific values, beliefs, attitudes, and desires in people, which shapes their perception of t he world. It means that media consumption leads to the shaping of people‘s mind -sets (Gerbner, 1998). Hence the long term effects of Korean media consumption in case of Hallyu wave can be understood with the help of cultivation theory. There is a possibili ty that the transnational audience might develop a different attitude, picture, imagery and ideology about anything portrayed in the popular cultural products such as Korean culture, Koreans and Korea. For example a positive image of Korea is constructed a mong the audience of K -pop culture makes them to visit Korea, buy Korean products (Jung, 2016; Trolan, 2017).   Cultural Imperialism/Americanization: The Hallyu phenomenon has strived to make the Korean pop culture known throughout the world. Hallyu not onl y has developed a sense of Koreanness among the people of Korea but also providing an identity to Asians in the world (Oh, 2009; Sung, 2012).   Hallyu is thus seen as the response to the dominant Western culture in one way (Kim, 2007; Kim et al., 2017). Th ere are also debates around Hallyu products being a copy cat of the west and invading the weaker markets of Asia as a form of cultural imperialism (Duong, 2016; Huang, 2009). Cultural imperialism can be defined as ―a verifiable process of social influence by which a nation imposes on other countries its sets of beliefs, values, knowledge and behavioural norms as well as its overall style of life‖ (Beltran, 1978, p. 184).Thus, the area concerning cultural imperialism and its linkage with Hallyu wave needs to  be researched upon in a much detailed manner
	.   Methods and research technique  This research is based on a systematic literature review, which provides an analysis on the emerging topics of a subject area (Jabbour, 2013, p. 145). According to Dewey & Drah ota (2016), a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) ―identifies, selects and critically appraises research in order to answer a clearly formulated question‖.   In field of media studies the systematic literature review has been utilized by various 
	   182 researchers to find out the relation between social media and outbreak and management of disease ( Charles -Smith et al., 2015 ), social media and sharing of knowledge (Ahmed et al., 2019), user generated content studies (Naab & Sehl, 2016), and in health communication r esearch (Moonrhead et al., 2013; Sharma et al., 2019) In the present study, the researchers have adapted the method of systematic literature review based on the works of Junior &  Filho (2010), Seuring (2013) andJabbour (2013) to analyse the research article s related to Hallyu wave on Google Scholar.   The reason why Google scholar was utilized for the present study is due to its free availability and convenient usage and the display of articles from where it can be sourced and found online.   Following are the various activities carried out in this literature review:   1. Identifying and analysing research articles on Google Scholar after extensively searching key words like Hallyu wave, Korean popular culture, K-dramas, K -pop music, K -movies from the year 2000 till 2019;  2. Developing a classification and coding for the key features of the articles;  3. Analysing the results obtained from the coding and classification of the articles and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the articles;  4. Providing the suggestions  for filling the main gaps after the analysis of the articles related to the subject matter.   The first steps of the methodology are presented here whereas the last two steps are discussed in the result section:   Characterization of the instrument and execution of the research:  The search in Google Scholar was only limited to research articles (journal articles, conference papers, proceedings) and omitted results that contained book reviews, thesis, and newspaper, magazines and website articles. The key w ords used for the Google Scholar search were Hallyu Wave, K -dramas, K -pop music, K -movie.  PRISMA flow diagram     *PRISMAstands for Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta -Analyses, ―is an evidence -based minimum set of items for reporting systematic reviews and meta -analyses‖( "PRISMA", 2020).   Initially, an analysis of the research articles carrying the citations on Google Scholar was made, as shown in Table A1. The purpose was to highlight the contributions made by these articles in the academia. Thr oughout the paper the order and sequencing was followed as was present in Table A1. In Table A2, after the evaluation of the issues raised by the authors in the selected articles, a brief summary of each article‘s objective is presented.   Note:  TABLE A1 a nd TABLE A2 are placed at the APPENDIX section of this research paper.  From the data collected from the analysis of the research articles related to Hallyu wave, the classification and coding for the articles was developed. There are around ten categories /classifications sequenced from 1 to 10 as these categories represent major subjects in the articles.  Book reviews (n=560)  Books (n=475)  Records after Google Scholar Search (n=5030)  Records after advanced Google Scholar Search (n=2480)  Title & Abstract screened (n=2480)  Records excluded (n=2180)  Total number of relevant articles included in analysis (n=100)  Full text articles accessed for eligibility (n=250)  Research   articles in foreign languages (n=590)  Thesis and dissertations (n=555)    
	   183 The coding for the classifications range from A to K as shown in Table 1:   Table 1: Categories and subcategories used in this paper  Category  Meaning  Code s of Alternative  1   Context (countries where  Hallyu has expanded)  A- High Income  B- Low and Middle Income  C- Low Income  D- Lower Middle Income  E- Middle income  F- Upper Middle Income  G- General (Worldwide)  H- Non - applicable  2 Geographic region  A- East Asia and Pacific  B- Europe and Central Asia  C- Latin America and Caribbean  D- Middle East and North Africa  E- North America  F- South Asia  G- Sub – Saharan Africa  H- General (Worldwide)  I- Non -applicable  3 Objective  A- Conceptually contributes to the subject  B- Presents a case study  C- Literature review / Critic al commentary  D- Non -applicable  4 Main subject  A- Related to fandom  B- Related to tourism  C- Related to fashion  D- Related to market & consumerism, consumption  E- Related to identity construction  F- Related to transnational flow, contra flow & globalisation  G- Related to international relations between Korea and other countries  H- Related to the growth, evolution of Hallyu  I- Related to the response to Hallyu  J- Others (Gendered perspective.

	   184 The first classification denotes the context of the research articles under study. Here context mean the countries where the expansion of Hallyu has taken place. The codes for context ranged from A to H. For the classification, the researchers have chosen the categorization of countries on the basis of income levels according to the World Bank from A to F.   The code G is used for General having a worldwide context whereas the code H stands for non - applicable when the studies do not fit under the codes pre sented. It is important to study the context in case of Hallyu wave as it gives us the idea whether countries where Hallyu has expanded have some relation with the income level or not.     The second classification denotes the identification of the geograp hic region of the research countries. With codes ranging from A to I, where A to G represent the countries falling under geographic region as per the World Bank, the code H represents General whereas code I is used for non -applicable meaning the studies do  not fit under the codes presented.   The third classification is about the objectives of the articles. It shows whether the article takes a conceptual approach or a case study taking about a particular case, instance, occasion or a literature review deali ng with the existing literature of the subject that might be looked from a critical angle. The summary of the objectives of the articles is presented in Table A1.   The fourth classification is about the main subject or focus of the articles with codes rang ing from A to K. Here, the concern is the identification of the key areas dealt in the articles.   The fifth classification involves the identification of the methods applied in the selected articles, coded from A to E. This step helps in verifying which m ethods are most used by the authors in articles regarding Hallyu wave.   The sixth classification deals with the identification of various dimensions analysed in the selected articles. It is coded from letters A to F. The aim here is to discover the dominan t dimension analysed in the articles.   The seventh classification is related to highlighting the various theories used while analysing Hallyu and its dimensions. It is coded using letters from A to K assessing whether the dominant theories used in the articles fall under the category of cultural studies, media studies, globalization etc.   The eighth classification deals with the identification of major topics covered in the articles, it is coded from A to H.   The ninth classification is related to the assessment of results of the articles under study. It is coded from letters A to F. The aim of this classification is to analyse whether there are new trends, perspectives emerging in the field related to Hallyu or added to the already existing knowledge and  literature.   Lastly, the tenth classification deals with the period during which the research studies have been conducted. The codes for this classification range from A to E, it assess the scope of the data collected in the studies.   RESULTS AND DISCUS SIONS  In this section, the overall categorization of the articles according to each classification and coding has been shown in Table 2.

	   187 Context:  The first classification dealt with the context of the research articles under study. Here context mean the countries where the phenomenon of Hallyu has expanded. The codes for context ranged from A to H. For the classification, the researchers have chosen  the categorization of countries on the basis of income levels according to the World Bank from A to F. Two more codes G and H were added to suit the research requirement. The codes are as follows: A - High Income, B – Low and Middle Income, C – Low Income , D – Lower Middle Income, E – Middle Income, F - Upper Middle Income, G - General (Worldwide), H – Non - applicable.   The results obtained after analyzing 100 articles are shown in Figure 1.    Figure.1   A majority of 41% of the studies were conducted in h igh income countries (A). It was followed by 16% studies in countries with upper middle income (F)and 14% studies in lower middle income (D). About 12% studies dealt with the countries all over the world in general (G) while 11% studies fall under the category of non -applicable (H). 5% of the studies were jointly conducted in countries with high income and upper middle income represented as (A, F) whereas only 1% of study was jointly conducted in countries with lower middle income and upper middle income (D , F). There was no study conducted in countries withlow and middle income (B); low income (C); and middle income (E). This showed that studies about Hallyu have been more focused on countries with high income rather than countries having middle income and low income. Thus exploring the Hallyu wave in low income countries is crucial.   Gap  1: There is a negligible amount of research conducted in countries with low income.   Geographic Region: After the identification of the countries where the Hallyu resear ch is being carried out. The researchers have used the categorization of geographic region according to the World Bank that showed the area these countries fitin (A -G). Two more codes H and I were added to fit the requirement of the research. The letters r ange for geographic region range from A to I as follows: A – East Asia and Pacific, B – Europe and Central Asia, C – Latin America and Caribbean, D - Middle East and North Africa, E – North America, F – South Asia, G - Sub – Saharan Africa, H – General (Worl dwide), I – Non – applicable.   This classification aimed at looking at the diversity of the articles related to Hallyu. The analysis can be seen in Figure.2    Figure.2   The analysis showed that the majority of 63% studies come from the region of East Asia and Pacific (A) whereas following it 12% of the studies have global reach (H). 6% of the articles have not mentioned the geographic region, hence falling in the category  (I); 5% of the articles come from the region of North America (E); 4% of the articles were from each of Middle East and North Africa (D) andSouth Asia (F). There were 3% articles that come 41%  5% 0% 0% 14%  1% 0% 16%  12%  11%  Classification: Context  A A, F B C D D, F EFG H 63%  3% 1% 1% 4% 5% 4% 1% 12%  6% Classification: Geographic Region  A B B, C C D E F G H I

Gap 2: More studies are needed from places other than East Asia and Pacific.   Objective:  This third classificati on dealt with the objectives of the research articles. The objectives were coded from A to D as follows: A – Conceptually contributes to the subject, B – Presents a case study, C – Literature review / Critical commentary, D – Non – applicable. The analysis  of the objective can be seen in Figure. 3.    Figure.3   From the analysis of the objectives in the selected articles, it was found that the majority of 79% articles were case study (B). It was followed by 12% of the articles that presented literature review / critical commentary (C); 9% of the articles conceptually contributed to the subject (A) while there were no articles falling under the option non - applicable (D).   Gap 3: Need for more defined concepts and terminology related to the field of Hally u.   Main subject : This fourth classification analysed the main subject of the articles used in the study. The main subject has been coded from A to K as follows: A - Related to fandom, B - Related to tourism, C - Related to fashion, D - Related to market & consumerism, consumption, E - Related to identity construction, F - Related to transnational flow, contra flow & globalization, G - Related to international relations between Korea and other countries, H - Related to the growth, evolution of Hallyu, I - Related to the response to Hallyu, J - Others (Gendered perspective. Class formation, Family structure, Gay rights, Film studies), K - Non - applicable. The analysis is shown in Figure. 4    Figure.4   From the analysis of the major subjects in the articles it was found that the majority of 19% of the articles were related to transnational flow, contra flow and globalization (F); 17% articles were related to market, consumerism and consumption (D); 13% articles were related to growth, evolution of Hallyu (H);  12% articles were related to fandom (A); 10% articles dealt with response of Hallyu (I); 8% articles were related to each of identity construction (E) and international relations between Korea and other countries (G); 7% articles were related to others (J ) option; 6% articles were related to tourism (B). However, there were no articles related to fashion (C) and under non -applicable (K) option.   Gap 4: Fashion is the least explored subject in the area of Hallyu research.   Methods used : This classification dealt with the various methods that have been utilized for the study. The codes for this category range from A to E as follows: A – Quantitative, B – Qualitative, C – Conceptual, D – Hybrid (Quantitative and qualitative; Qualitative and quantitative), E – Non – applicable. The analysis for the used methods is shown in Figure. 5  9% 79%  12%  0% Classification: Objective  ABCD12 6 0 17 8 19 8 13 10 7 0 0 5 10 15 20ABCDEFGHIJK

There were no articles that did not mention the methods used hence none of the articles fit under the non -applicable option.   Gap 5: There is a requirement of new studies in the field of Hallyu wave that uti lizes hybrid methods.   Dimension Analyzed:  This sixth classification dealt with identifying the various dimensions of the Hallyu wave. The codes for this category range from letters A to F as follows: A – Hallyu, B – K-Drama, C – K-Pop, D – K-Movies, E – General (Korean Media) , F – Non – applicab le.   The analysis for the dimensions covered in the articles is shown in Figure.6    Figure.6   The majority of 41% of the articles analyzed the overall dimension of Hallyu (A). It was followed by 31% that involved the analysis of the dimension of K -dramas  (B); 13% articles covered the K -pop (C) as the major dimension; 12% articles analyzed the dimension of K -movies (D); and 3% articles discussed in general, the Korean media (E). None of the articles fit under the non -applicable (F) option.  Gap 6: K-pop an d K-movies both appear to be overlooked dimension and thus there is a necessity of more studies that deal with K -pop and K -movies in future.   Theoretical Framework used: The seventh classification dealt with the identification of various theoretical framew orks utilized in the selected articles. The codes for this category range from the letters A to K as follows: A – Uses & gratifications approach, B – Cultural hybridity, C – Cultural diplomacy / Soft power, D – Audience / Reception analysis – Stuart Hall‘s  encoding decoding, E – Cultural proximity, F – Cultural discount, G – Media dependency, H – Cultivation analysis, I – Cultural imperialism / Americanization, J – Others (Brand placement; Grounded Theory; Pop nationalism; Diffusion of Innovation; Agenda se tting; Cultural Regionalization; Word of mouth; Data analysis; Construction Theory; Windowing; Melodrama; Feminism; Globalization, Sexuality; Dramaturgy; Confucianism; Multilingualism; Structural Equation Mode; Film induced tourism; Social change; Cultural  technology; Social learning theory).

	   190 Around 36% of the articles were from the others option (J); 15% articles used the Audience/ Reception analysis (D) as their theoretical framework; 13% articles each utilized Cultural hybridity (B) and Cultural diplomacy/ Soft power (C) as the main theoreti cal framework; whereas 11% articles did not clearly mention their theoretical framework hence non -applicable (K) option. 6% articles made use of the cultural proximity (E) as their theoretical reference; and each of the 2% articles used Uses & gratificatio ns approach (A); Cultural discount (F); Cultural imperialism/Americanization (I) as their theoretical framework. None of the articles utilized the theories of Media dependency (G) and Cultivation analysis (H), the major theories of mass communication.   Gap 7:  There is an absence of studies which have used Media dependency and Cultivation analysis in the study of Hallyu and its dimensions. Hence, future studies must incorporate these media theories.   Topics:  The eighth classification involved the identifi cation of various topics that were covered in the articles. The codes for the category included the letters from A to H as follows: A – Linkage of govt. support to Hallyu; B – Increasing negative sentiments and outrage towards Hallyu, C – Hallyu as an imag e building tool for South Korea, D – Link of new media technologies, Social networking, YouTube with soaring popularity of Hallyu, E – Construction of spaces and online communities of Hallyu, F – Perception towards Hallyu, G – Others ( Exportability of mov ies;  Brand Placement in movies; Rising indigenous capacity of Korean media producers; Religion as  a contributory factor for Hallyu; Family in Hallyu; Love values in K-drama; Role of gender; Cultural values; Hallyu as mobilizing source; Active audience; Multilingual identity; Hallyu as a pull for tourism; Destination image; Fandom as subculture; Global positioning of Hallyu; Representation of narrators in K -movies), H – Non – applicable. The results are presented in the Figure. 8    Figure.8   The majority of 27% articles have topics that fit under the option of others (G); followed by 24% articles related to the topics of link of new media technologies, Social networking, YouTube with soaring popularity of Hallyu (D) and 22% articles related to perception towards Hallyu (F). 12% articles have topics concerning linkage of governmental support to Hallyu (A); 9% articles‘ have topics related to Hallyu as an image building tool for South Korea (C); 4% articles have topics related to construction of spaces and on line communities of Hallyu (E); and 2% articles have topics that dealt with increasing negative sentiments and outrage towards Hallyu (B). However, no articles were found in the non -applicable (H) option.   Gap 8: There is a need for more studies that look at the growth of Hallyu critically.   Results:  The ninth classification presented the results of the research articles included in the analysis. It was coded with letters from A to F as follows: A – Comparative study, B – Newer perspective (Anti -Hallyu sent iments, Gendered perspectives, Cultural diffusion, Role of narrators, Fan activism), C - Evaluation of the effect, impact, and influence of Hallyu, D – Observations and experiences from Hallyu, E – Past, present and future of Hallyu, F – Non – applicable.

	   191  Figure.9  A majority of 53% articles dealt with the results involving evaluation of the effect, impact and influence of Hallyu (C). It was followed by 26% articles that have results mentioning newer perspectives in the field of Hallyu (B); 14% articles‘ results deal t with observations and experiences from Hallyu (D); 4% articles‘ results dealt with the past, present and future of Hallyu (E) while 3% articles‘ results had comparative study (A). Also there were no articles falling under non -applicable option (F).   Gap  9: More comparative studies in the area of Hallyu are required.   Analysis period:  Finally, the tenth classification dealt with the period the data has been analysed in the selected articles. The codes were developed from the letters A to E as follows: A – Less than 3 yrs, B – Between 3 -5 yrs, C – Between 5 -10 yrs, D – More than 10 yrs, E – Non – applicable. The analysis is shown in Figure. 10     Figure.10   Most of 67% articles did not mention the period of analysis thus fit under the code, non –applicable (E). It was followed by 24% of the articles with the analysis period of less than  3 yrs (A); 4% articles with the analysis period between 5 -10 yrs (C); 3% articles with the analysis period between 3 -5 yrs (B); and 2% articles with the analysis period more than 10 yrs (D).   Gap 10: There is a deficit of studies that have longer time pe riods. To measure and understand the impact made by Hallyu in the long run, studies with longer terms are required.   CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS  This article focused on the central theme of Hallyu wave to explore how the area has grown in field of aca demic research. As the South Korean popular culture is still spreading due to the power of social networking and new media, the phenomenon of Hallyu is in recent discussion and a growing field.Observing the material in the research articles on Google Schol ar from 2000 -2019, the present study aimed at presenting the major subjects of the Hallyu research and therefore, identified gaps that can be further used as opportunities in development of new areas of research in future. This article used the proposition s made by Junior & Filho (2010) and adapted it to analyse the articles searched on Google Scholar. Mainly, a total of ten categories were established and ten gaps were identified from the selected articles.   In the first classification context was analyse d which studied the extent of Hallyu‘s reach in terms of income level. It showed that there is a direct relation between the number of researches and income; in high income countries more researches are being done and in low income countries there are less er studies. This implied that Hallyu certainly have a huge audience in high income countries whereas there might be a possibility that Hallyu was apparently unknown to a less population in low income countries. Thus researchers could explore the reasons fo r the slow reach of Hallyu in low income countries and also investigate the attempts of the Korean government to popularize Hallyu in low income countries.  3% 26%  53%  14%  4% 0% Classification: Result  A B C D E F24%  3% 4% 2% 67%  Classification: Analysis of Period  A B C D E
	   192 In the second classification of geographic region, the aim was to analyse the diversity of the Hally u research meaning which region the studies focused on. It was found that most of the studies on Hallyu had focused on the region of East Asia and Pacific whereas the regions of Europe & Central Asia, Latin America & Caribbean, and Sub -Saharan Africa have been hardly studied. This explained that the phenomenon of Hallyu has been extensively studied in the region of East Asia & Pacific owing to its origin, whereas in regions of Europe & Central Asia, Latin America & Caribbean and Sub -Saharan Africa, Hallyu h as still not attained peak popularity and thus researchers there must pay more attention to the growth of Hallyu. In the third classification the objectives of the research articles were analysed.   The analysis showed that majority of the studies was case study discussing a particular instance, scenario whereas conceptual studies were least in number. This showed the convenience of focusing on individual cases over working on theories and conceptual framework related to the subject of Hallyu.Hence, research ers should undertake research studies that add to the conceptual understanding of Hallyu in developing new terminologies, theories and ideas related to Hallyu phenomenon in future.  In the fourth classification, the analysis of major subjects of the selecte d research articles was made. The main subject included the discourse around globalization in majority whereas there were a minimal number of research articles that discussed tourism as the main subject while none of the articles had fashion as their subje ct. This indicated that Hallyu‘s expansion was mostly seen as a transnational flow of media, information resulting out of globalisation and was explored to a large extent contrary to subjects like fashion, tourism etc. Hence, the researchers must incorpora te interdisciplinary approach.   In the fifth classification, the methods used in the research articles were analysed. While the majority of the research articles used the qualitative methods, the use of hybrid methods was least utilized in the research articles. This emphasized the reliance on subjective data over objective data.Thus, there is a need for researchers to develop studies that use hybrid or mixed methods approach so that there could be a balance between objectivity and subjectivity.   In the sixth classification, dimensions of Hallyu were analysed. The most prominent dimension was of Hallyu wave itself, followed by the dimension of K -dramas whereas Korean media was the least explored dimension. This indicated the hierarchy among the dimensions  of Hallyu so; the dimensions of K -pop, K -movies along with the Korean media in general should be investigated more by th  e researches in future.   In the seventh classification, the theoretical framework utilized in the articles was analysed. As the resear ch of Hallyu is multidisciplinary, a lot of theories from different fields have been applied during the study of Hallyu phenomenon that has resulted in majority of the articles resorting to the others option whereas audience reception was the widely used t heoretical background for maximum number of studies. On the other hand, none of the articles utilized Media dependency theory and Cultivation analysis. This illustrated that audiences make up a large section of Hallyu studies and more media theories should  be utilized in studying Hallyu in future studies.   In the eighth classification, the topics covered under Hallyu‘s research area were analysed.  Due to the vast range of topics the majority research articles used the others option whereas the maximum numb er of studies had topics related to linkage of social media, networking to the growth of Hallyu and Hallyu‘s perception. However, there were least number of studies that talked about growing unpopularity and negative perception of Hallyu
	. This implied that  the researches focused more on factors related to Hallyu‘s success, perception of Hallyu whereas least attention was paid to negative information about Hallyu. Thus, there is need to look at Hallyu critically in countries where it has been receiving non -acceptance, loss of popularity and negative reviews.   In the ninth classification, the analysis of results of the research articles was carried out. It was found that most of the studies discussed about the effects of the Hallyu phenomena 
	   193 whereas least atte ntion was paid to comparative studies. Thus, more comparative studies must be undertaken by the researchers in future. In the tenth classification, the analysis period of the studies was investigated. It was found that maximum numbers of studies were of sh ort duration having analysis period of less than 3 years whereas the minimum number of studies were found having analysis period more than 10 years. Hence, there is a requirement of studies for longer duration so that the phenomenon of Hallyu can be studie d in detail and critically.   There are also some limitations to the study. As this research is an exploratory attempt to analyse the trends, major concepts in the field of Hallyu wave with research articles selected on Google Scholar within a time frame of  2000 -2019, in future studies the relationship of Hallyu with major subjects can be investigated. For example: Hallyu and cultural proximity or Hallyu and audience reception etc. In addition, the present research only included studies from Google Scholar h ence more databases such as Scopus, JSTOR can be explored for more rigorous results and identification of gaps in the research area. It was noticed that the present study allowed the researcher to introduce and explore the overall context of the Hallyu res earch and led to the understanding of the gaps existing in the research domain, which could further be explored by other researchers.

A Representative Study of People‟s Perspective on Controlling  the Spread of Fake News on Social Media   Adharsh Raj  Postgraduate Scholar, Department of Media and Communication,  School of Communication, Central University of Tamil Nadu, India   Manash Pratim Goswami  Associate Professor and Head, Department of Media and Communication,  School of Communication, Central Univ ersity of Tamil Nadu, India,   ABSTRACT   Fake news is not a new phenomenon. With the mushrooming of smartphone users and the easy access to the internet, fake news is spreading at very high speed from people to people. Why do people flagrantly believe fake  news? Why don‘t people fact -check before sharing information with others? etc., are still some of the questions unanswered. The panic created by fake news during the time of the Covid -19 pandemic outbreak is also not less. Hence, this study aims to focus on understanding people‘s perspectives on controlling the spread of fake news on social media. The respective study is based on quantitative data analysis of the responses of 300 social media users across India, collected online in April 2020 during nation wide lockdown.The study arrived at a conclusion stating that self -regulation may not deliver a proper effect on controlling the spread of fake news. But, organising effective campaigns to build social media literacy can be one of the potential measures tha t can be implemented in order to control the spread of fake news over social media platforms. The respondents of the study also agree to bring -in a national policy and a national regulatory body to control the spread of fake news over social media platform s. Hence, this particular study can support Government of India to make decisions to roll out regulatory measures to control the spread of fake news through social media, which is still on the red tape.   Keywords : Fake news, Social media, National policy, Self-regulation, Regulatory body.   INTRODUCTION  The spread of the Corona Virus Disease (Covid -19) across the globe has already left the world in a grim situation. The petrifying part is that the number of people affected by the Covid -19 as well as the spread of this deadly virus to different countries i s increasing day by day. Different nations across the world have taken several measures to tackle the spread of the virus. Covid -19, which is said to have originated from Wuhan city, China, in 2019, has been in the news for months.   A humongous number of fake news stories are being shared through different social media platforms during the wake of this pandemic. The current study is based on the spread of fake news amidst the unroll of novel coronavirus throughout the world. As the world is exposed to a co mpletely new pandemic, for which even vaccines are not yet discovered and symptoms or the behavior of the virus is not yet confirmed, this study contains new and interesting information concerning the attitudes of the people on the fast-spreading fake news  during the time of Covid -19 and the role played by social media platforms on the same. The spread of fake news ata much higher pace than the real news shows that controlling measures or legal actions in India for spreading fake news are not much adequate.  Thus, this study also aims to understand any possible measures to control the spread of fake news in social media platforms in India. Hence it becomes important to study people's perspectives on controlling the spread of fake news on social media.   Accord ing to the Collins Dictionary, fake news is false, often provoking, information disseminated under the form of news reporting
	. Fake news is forged information that imitates news contents in form but not in organizational purpose (Lazer, et al., 2018). Fake  news lap over other major information disorders such as misinformation and disinformation (Lazer, et al., 2018). The term 
	 209  fake news was popularised during the 2016 US elections ( Egelhofer , et al., 2020). Spreading fake news is not a new form of propaganda  building. Accurate beliefs lead to the formation of many adaptive or modified behaviors. One supporter of mistaken convictions is misinformation, including fake news, which comprises created news stories that are introduced as being from authentic sources  and elevated mostly via web -based networking sites to trick people in general for the ideological or monetary benefit (Lazer, et al., 2018). Actually, even an earlier exposure stimulates later trust in fake news, even when features are challenged by fact -checkers or are conflicting with the reader‘s political dogma (Pennycook, Cannon, & Rand, 2018).   Amidst the growth in high speed internet in India, the number of first time users of the internet are also increasing drastically (Kalorth, N., & Verma, M., 2 018), irrespective of age. The new users definitely are overloaded with information available online in the form of varied digital contents. While misinformation is dissemination of fake data trusting it is true, disinformation, which is more riskier, is t he dissemination of fake news deliberately ( Kalorth, N., & Verma, M., 2018) . The massive growth of fake news and its disintegration of democracy, justice, and public trust has essentially expanded the interest for accurate fake news detection. The present -day headways in this area have proposed new techniques that aim to detect fake news by analysing how it is spread on social media networks ( Zhou, X., &Zafarani, R., 2018) .   Using social media for consuming news is like using a double -edged sword. On the one hand, it is cost -effective and fast, but on the other hand, the information that we are consuming may be fake ones ( Shu, et al., 2017) . Due to the cheap availability and easy access, social media platforms are mostly used to propagate fake infor mation. And, the rapid spread of fake news has the potential to impart a negative effect on the individual and the whole society ( Shu, et al., 2017) . Thus, people‘s perspectives on controlling the spread of fake news is an important area to be studied. The  findings of this study will be different and novel as the study is dealing with the spread of fake news amidst the unfurl of Covid -19 in India. The study aims at bringing in possible measures to curb the spread of fake news. Through analysing the people‘s  perspectives, the current study is expected to arrive at a set of findings which will be able to state effective measures to control the spread of fake news in India.   REVIEW OF RELEVANT LITERATURE  History overflows with different instances of bending re ality for material augmentation, famously called lying, or flexing reality for political gain, named purposeful publicity. Fake news is commonly thought to be as old as journalism itself, and legitimate media associations have only from time to time assume d a job of "gatekeeper" for reliable data (Banerjee, A. N., & Haque, M. N., 2018) . Accounts from history show that the use of fake news has been prevalent from the BCs (Weir, 2009). With the invention of the printing press in 1439, the publications became widespread. Even from the initial days, fake news has tended to provoke, arouse passions, and is also biased in nature.   It is also to be noted that it has often aroused violence.The Nazi propaganda machine relied on one of the famous false stories of the  Jewish practice of drinking blood from children which in the fifteenth century had led to systematic persecution against Jews. Soon after Johannes Gutenberg invented the printing press, fake news stories also began to travel from one place to another. And , with the lack of technology during those times, it was a herculean task to distinguish between real news and fake news. Readers in search of real news had to pay close observation
	. Leaked secret government reports were considered as authentic sources in the 16th century. But, before long, the fake copies of the real ones started to be available in the market. During the 17th century, in order to tackle the spread of fake news, historians started to verify news by publishing their sources of information as  verifiable footnotes (The Long and Brutal History of Fake News, n.d). The following years witnessed an exponential growth in terms of printing and on par with this, the spread of fake news also was on a hike.   Fake news was created based on the stories o f the existence of witches and sea monsters and they went to the extent of disseminating claims that argue the reason for natural 
	 210  disasters are sinners, and, no matter what, the fake stories kept on influencing people. The spread of fake news during the ti me of an emergency as well as during elections is high compared to other times (Hunt, Agarwal, Aziz, & Zhuang, 2020; Allcott, H., & Gentzkow, M., 2017 ). Disseminating fake news can cause serious impacts on society. The technological advancements in a smart phone with internet connectivity are also playing its part in the spread of fake news ( Alianto, H., & Chandra, Y. U., 2017) .    It is to be noted that in India and other ten emerging economies such as Venezuela, Lebanon, South Africa, Columbia, Kenya, Mexi co, Philippines, Vietnam, Jordan, and Tunisia, smartphone and social media use are heavily intertwined. According to a study, while a median of 91% of the people in the above -mentioned countries use both smartphones and social media, a median of 81% of the  people using social media own or share a smartphone ( Silver, L., & Huang, C., 2019).   Today, smartphones are an inevitable part of human lives‘ (Miakotko, 2017). Smartphones are evolving at a very high pace and with their technological advancements, smart phones let its users to be connected to the world always, mostly by providing instant communication (Durak, 2018). According to Andone et al (2016), the highest phone usage was seen among teenagers who are between 12 years and 17 years. They also state in their study that Females use phones more than males. For fake news to spread, it requires three important ingredients such as the tools and services for manipulation, relevant social media networks, and motivation for action. Tools and services to spread f ake news are abundantly available in social media networks. When social media networks act as a tool to spread fake news propaganda, the speed in which fake news spread is very high. The motivation for spreading fake news always comes with the question -‗why‘. Often, it‘s for monetary gain via advertising, whereas, in some other cases the gain varies from criminal to political. Keeping the motive apart, the real success of fake news depends on the reach it got, as well as the effect it imparted on the target  audience which can make an overall change in the real world (Goswami, 2018).   We are living in a networked society where anyone can write and post anything on social media platforms. The idea of gatekeeping in social media is still bizarre. As it seems l ike censorship is quite impossible in social media handles, we are living in an era of free speech for all. But, the number of information that we come across may be true and may not be true. Believing everything that we see over the internet can catalyse the process of being a misinformed society. With billions of daily users, social media platforms prove to play a vital role in the dissemination of news, opinions, comments and even personal updates.   Users can find up -to-date information on any topic of interest in social media platforms. Even when there are benefits of social media, the unmoderated use of these platforms can make mishaps as well. When fake information is spread on social media networks, it can result in umpteen numbers of misinformed audiences. According to the statistics, during the past decade, there has been a tremendous hike in the amount of false news spread during crisis events, such as natural disasters and terrorist attacks. This misinformation proves to be very dangerous during t hese grim situations (Hunt, Agarwal, Aziz, & Zhuang, 2020). Consequently, with the ubiquity of the number of social media outlets such as WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc., the amount of information exchanged or the misinformation is rising ever y second.   A misinformed society is a real threat to democracy and it is the responsibility of everyone to share information over the internet with more culpability. Forwarding every piece of information without proper fact-checking can land the entire society in a bigger threat
	. Age of the users is a significant factor while talking about spreading fake news. According to Guess et al., (2019), Americans who are above 60 years of age share fake news the most and the media literacy among the same group is very less. As  stated earlier, the term ‗fake news‘ is not of a recent origin, but the medium used to share and further make it viral is comparatively new. Fake news stories are not anymore a threat only for western countries, but, the threat of fake news can be seen al most 
	 211  everywhere including India, which is considered as a third world country.   Nowadays creating and disseminating fake news is widely popular and that can affect the public in a negative way. With the easy availability of cheap mobile data, data usage has increased tremendously. About three out of five social media users in India believe that the usage of social media has made it easier to manipulate people with fake news. It is to be noted that Indian users spent two and a half hours on social media and  also the Indian and Chinese users' patterns of using social media have converged (Krishnan, 2019).   When the world is fighting a bleak situation like the roll out of Covid -19, the spread of fake news related to that can induce panic in society. This can l ead to ineffectiveness in implementing control measures imposed by different governments. Fake news stories that even propose the medications for Covid -19, such as drinking cow -urine can kill the virus, has not only made the Indian society misinformed but also, the decline in the common sense of Indians has become a topic of debate across the globe. Even though the governments have made the point clear that no cures are found to tackle the pandemic, the demand for products including home testing kits has in creased all over the web. Online opportunists are working hard to take advantage of the public‘s anguish, they are selling medicines claiming that it can cure Covid -19 through social media platforms, e -commerce marketplaces, as well as the dark web ( Heilwe il, R., 2020) .  According to news reports, the Government of India was planning to bring regulations on social media platforms by January 2020 ( Ians, 2019) . But, some of the experts say that the government should not bring -in any regulation over social med ia, as it is the clear violation of freedom of expression of the individuals ( Indian social media users may lose their anonymity soon, 2020) . In fact, India‘s National Policy to control the social media usage is still on the red tape, even when the country  is facing an umpteen number of problems due to the uncontrollable creation and dissemination of fake news, that can disrupt the entire smooth functioning of the nation. Hence, this study which focuses on the need and importance of bringing out some possib le controlling measures such as framing laws, developing media literacy, promoting self-regulation, adopting technological tools for filtering,  etc., to curb the spread of fake news stories over social media platforms in India is relevant to be conducted.  The findings of the respective study will be novel because the Covid -19 is a very recent pandemic outbreak and the fake news is still inducing certain effects on its audience.   Theoretical Framework  Fake news isn't novel ( Banerjee, A. N., & Haque, M. N., 2018). A plethora of theories on psychology as well as perceptions of people sharing fake news are present today. Social Identity theory was proposed by Tajfel Turner and it is considered to be one of the greatest contributions of Turner (McLeod, 2019). Ta jfel Turner, et al. (1979) states that social identity is a person's self -concept derived from membership in a relevant social group. That is, groups to which individuals belong were an important source of self -esteem and pride for them (McLeod, 2019).   According to Social identity theory and Normative influence theory, people consume and share news that is ‗socially safe‘ to be shared, in order to gain social acceptance, which is a must for an individual‘s self -esteem and identity. Thus, it can be said th at very often people might be sharing news without proper fact checking to show the society that I am a well -informed person and I know everything. On the other hand, according to Prospect theory, people make decisions based on the relative loss and gains compared to their current states. The gain can be of social acceptance too, and while combining the Social Identity Theory and Prospect Theory, it can be assumed that, in order to maintain or gain social acceptance, people might share information without p roper fact checking
	. The rise in partisan social media groups also can act on this.  Rather than giving objective and unaltered versions of news, these partisan media groups filter information according to the values and traditions of ingroup biases.    This leads to believing what the consumers like rather than believing what is true (Leonard, 2018). These information from partisan media outlets will be further shared even if it is a fake information. The theory of media literacy on the other hand, accordin g to 
	 212  W. James Potter (2014) is a cognitive approach which broadly explains how an individual absorbs information amidst the information explosion in a media -saturated society and how people construct faulty meanings from those pieces of information. Accord ing to Uses and Gratification theory, people use media for fulfilling their own needs. Hence, often, during the times of emergency, people might share fake news to fulfill their own psychological pleasure by inducing panic in the society or by thinking of the targeted results to be achieved through sharing fake information.An example for this is the 2016 US Presidential election in which fake news was used as a tool to create public votes (Shirsat, 2018). That is, the election campaigners used social media as one of the tools to propagate fake news for their own gratification.   According to Two -step flow theory, information that is shared with the opinion leaders in a community, which is further shared by them with the less active users or the opinion follo wers, can create an impact in the thought process of an entire society (Elkin, 1957). It can be said that the politicians use this model for their propaganda building during the times of election. The 2016 US Presidential election and the hike in fake news  is a good example for this. Trump‘s victory in the 2016 US Presidential election is an example for effectively utilising Magic Bullet Theory too, even though it is considered to be out -fashioned with reality (Fayoyin, 2016). According to popular narrative , people voted for Trump because they believed in fake news and conspiracy theories against Hillary Clinton that were spread on social media platforms like Facebook (Marwick, 2018). Hence, it can be said that the passive consumers of social media will beli eve anything and everything that they get through social networking sites and they may further forward it.   The following objectives are set for the current study after carefully analysing the relevant literature in the area.  1. To study the attitude of the p eople in spreading fake news during the wake of Covid -19 in India.  2. To analyse the role of social media in spreading fake news amidst the outbreak of Covid -19 among Indian social media users.  3. To explore any possible measures to control the spread of fake ne ws in social media platforms in India .  Research Questions  The objectives set for the study and the available literature on the topic have led to framing the following research questions:   RQ1 : Do the variables such as Age, Gender, Education, Location, and  Occupation have any significant association with Social media usage, Fake news, and Opinion on taking possible measures to regulate social media platforms?   RQ2 : Are the Variables like Social media usage, Fake news, and Opinion on having regulation for So cial media platforms interrelated?   RESEARCH METHODOLOGY  The main objective of this study is to explore any possible measures such as framing laws, developing media literacy, promoting self -regulation, adopting technological tools for filtering, etc. for s ocial media platforms to control the spread of fake news. In the respective study which uses a quantitative research technique, factors such as Social media usage, Fake news, and opinions to take possible measures to control social media will be analysed.   Apart from these, demographic variables such as Age, Gender, Education, Location, and Occupation also will be analysed. The sample size of the respective study is 300 social media users across India, selected through a snowball sampling procedure. An onl ine survey was conducted in April 2020, to collect perspectives from the selected individuals. The questionnaire for the survey will consists of 33 questions dealing with all the selected variables. The survey was conducted among individuals of age interva l between less than 20 and above 34 years
	. The views of each individual have been considered as one unit. The web of relationships between these variables will be analysed using statistical tools after the completion of data collection.    
	 213  DATA ANALYSIS  According to statistical tests, the researcher has arrived at certain findings.

The average Smartphone usage among people belonging to Less than 20 years age group is found to be more (mean = 18.3) than other age groups. Als o, the tendency to spread fake news was seen mostly among the people who are Above 34 years of age (mean = 38.75) and also the average of the same group of people belonging to Above 34 years of age (mean = 30.38) says more to have controlling measures to c urb the spread of fake news.   T-Test results indicate that there is a significant relationship only with the variable gender and fake news. And there is no statistically -significant relationship between the variables gender and smartphone usage and also no significant relationship was found between Gender and Opinion on having controlling measures over social media. However the averages for the Smartphone usage, fake news and Opinion on having regulation differed for these two genders. The average Smartphone usage among male (mean = 17. 05) is found more than females. Whereas, females are sharing more fake news (mean = 38.13) compared to male.   The average Opinion on having controlling measures to curb the spread of fake news is found more among females (mean = 27.67) while compared to m ale.

The averages of smartphone usage, fake news spread and opinion on having control over social  media differs among people having different Educational qualifications. The average of  smartphone usage is found more amoung Plus two (mean = 17.47). And people with an educational qualification of class 10 or below tend to spread more fake news (mean = 17.05) than plus two, UG and PG or above.

When Smartphone usage and fake news showed a positive correlation Smartphone usage and opinion on having a national policy showed a negative correlation. That is, with an increase in the usage of smartphones, more fake news will be spread over the social media and the ones who use the smartph ones most are against having any control over social media to curb the spread of fake news in social media.   DISCUSSION  By analysis of the result, the study arrived at several interesting findings.   Smartphone Usage:  Smartphones have become one of the inevitable parts in the lives of the people (Miakotko, 2017) . The usage pattern differed with differences in age, gender, education, occupation as well as location. While the present study arrived at a finding similar to the conclusions of Andone et al., ( 2016) regarding the smartphone usage and the age of the users, a contradiction was seen in smartphone usage and the gender of the users. That is, similar to the findings of Andone et al., (2016), in the present study also it was found that smartphones are mostly used by teenagers who are less than 20 years of age. According to Andone et al., (2016), females used smartphones more. But, in the present study it was found that the average smartphone usage of males is slightly higher than that of females. In con formity with the results of the present study, it is to be noted that the average of smartphone usage is more among the ones with a Plus -2 educational qualification. The use of smartphones depended on the location of the users as well. While the study resu lts state that the ones who hail from metro settings used the smartphones the most, the ones from rural settings used smartphones the least. In compliance with the study, it can be seen that the smartphones are mostly used by the employed people or the ones who have a regular income, and it is least used by homemakers.   Spreading Fake News:   According to Guess et al., (2019), Americans who are above 60 years of age share fake news the most and the media literacy among the same group is very less. In the p resent study it was found that Indian‘s who are above 34 years of age tend to spread fake news the most. This can be due to lack of media literacy among Indians and the delayed technological advancements in India. It is interesting to note that the ones wh o are above 34 years of age think it is lawful to share fake news and they also think it is normal to create and share fake news during emergency situations like Covid -19.   The young block of the country who are less than 20 years of age strongly believes that it is the responsibility of an individual to fact check an information prior to sharing it further and the above 34 years group believes the same the least. The respect ive study result confirms that the females spread fake news more than that of males in India. The study results also state that the ones with an education of class 10 or below tend to spread fake news the most. It is also to be noted that the fake news rol ls out the most in metros and is spread the most by homemakers. All these shows the lack of social media literacy among Indians. According to the Magic Bullet theory, which Fayoyin (2016) suggests as out -dated with reality, passive consumers of the media m essages will believe anything and everything that they get through social networking sites and they may further forward it. Hence, it is important to build the media literacy of Indian social media users.   Opinion on Controlling Measures: While analysing the results of the present study, it is interesting to note that the above 34 years age group believes the most that it is better to control social media platforms in India in order to curb the spread of fake news
	. Whereas, the young block, the social medi a users below the age of 20 years, are very much critical of the same. It is also to be noted that the females believe the most that it is time to control the social media platforms in India.   Hence, it can be said that even though the above 34 years aged  users and the female users tend to spread the fake news the most over social media, the same groups urge to bring in certain controlling measures on social media platforms. While the ones with an education of class 10 or below vote for implementing contro lling measures, the users belonging to the city setting believe the same 
	 218  the most. The study result put forward another interesting finding, which is, the unemployed section of the country says the most that it is better to have some sort of control over s ocial media to stop the spread of fake news. The study which focused on understanding any possible measures to control the spread of fake news in social media platforms in India, comes up with a set of measures that can be implemented in India.   While the  study results points out that the self -regulation will be not an effective way to control the spread of fake news, organising effective campaigns among the social media users, having in -built filters in social media platforms to identify fake news, having  regulations on social media through a national policy and framing a statutory body controlled by the government of India to regulate the social media contents are the key measures that can be implemented. It can be said that it is the time for Indian gove rnment to strengthen its thought of rolling -out social media regulations, for the collective good of the Indian society.     CONCLUSION  In times of crisis, misinformation abounds. A misinformed society can make chaos around the globe. With the increase in smartphone usage and cheap internet access, in the time of Covid -19 as well the number of fake news being made and further shared is snowballing in a very high velocity. The fake news stories are flooding social media platforms in each second. People who c reate fake news pretend to be doctors, statisticians and experts, whereas, the ones who share those are pushing the society into a furthermore grim situation. The present study is focused on understanding the kinds of solutions that can be implemented so a s to control the widespread of fake news over social media. The study has come out with a number of interesting findings.The ones who use smartphones more tend to spread more fake news and the same group of people do hold the views that are against forming  a national policy or having a national regulatory body to curb the spread of fake news in India. The present study could also reinforce the Social Identity theory, which says, people may be sharing the news information that they get from different social media networks, which may be fake, so as to maintain their social acceptance in the society.   The study results indicated that the Indian‘s lack social media literacy and that can be one of the potential reasons behind sharing anything and everything that  they come across in social media platforms without a proper fact checking. According to the lion‘s share of respondents, it is more or less impossible to distinguish between real news and fake news. The theory of media literacy explains how people absorb information amidst the information explosion in a media -saturated society and how they construct faulty meanings from those pieces of information.  According to the respective study, most of the people say that Indians lack media literacy. Hence, effective campaigns or programs from the side of the Government or social media platforms are essential to build a society who are media literate.   Most of the respondents believe that it is common to have a flood of fake news during the times of emergency and a wh opping majority of the respondents say that fake news creates unnecessary panic in the society. The sharing of fake news during the times of emergency can be linked to the uses and gratification theory. That is, vested interests may be sharing fake news fo r their own gratification. It is also interesting to note that some of the people believe that spreading fake news is a lawful activity and majority of the respondents have shared some fake news related to Covid -19 knowingly or unknowingly. A further inter esting finding is that even when the people believe that it is the responsibility of an individual to fact -check an information before further sharing, the majority of the respondents didn‘t do a proper fact-checking
	.   When the respondents say self -regulation is not a good idea, organising effective campaigns to build social media literacy is one of the measures that can be implemented in order to control the spread of fake news over social media platforms. The study arr ived at a conclusion stating that it is time to bring in a national policy to control the spread of fake news over social media platforms. And, the respondents also opined that there should be stringent actions including huge fines and jail terms against t he ones who spread fake news. 
	 219  An important finding of the study is that it is time for India to have a National Regulatory Body to frame legal implications defining the after effects of propagating fake news.   Hence, it can be assumed that it is necessary  for the Government of India to think about a National Regulatory Body for controlling social media, like Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) which regulates the telecom sector or Press Council of India which regulates the press. The different soc ial media platforms also can bring -in in -built filters in the respective platforms to stop sharing fake news. Thus, the findings of this study generate managerial implications for the social media corporates and the government of India to think accordingly  to control the social media platforms in India.   This present study may be observed with certain limitations. India, a country with the second highest population in the world, hasa huge size of active social media users. However, the responses of a sample  size of 300 individuals were collected through snowball sampling for the current study. Hence, if the future studies are conducted with a reasonable sample size, more meaningful conclusions may be drawn. Examining more demographic groups and analysing mor e perceptions and attitudes of the social media users may be done by the future researchers on the topic of current research. With the current pace in technological advancements in every sector, the speed of new social media advancements is also likely to increase. Thus, so far, theoretical backing for social media usage is still lacking. Hence, it is very much important to ground new theories that deal with social media usage in utmost urgency.

The social media platforms have become a reliable source of communication with consumers and are shaping consumers' purchase intentions. Therefore, a framework was developed to explain and empirically verify the factors shaping green purchase in tentions. Three factors Social media usage, Interpersonal Influence and E -WOM have been taken as exogenous variables. The model was tested and validated statistically with the help of structural equation modeling.Total 500 respondents were sampled to colle ct the data. All four hypotheses were found to be statistically significant.  The impact of social media usage was found to be most influential on purchase intention. The findings of the study will aid marketers to better understand how social media plays an important role in shaping consumers' purchase intentions and how social media can be leveraged in a better way to encourage green consumption among millennials.  Keywords: Social Media Usage, Interpersonal Influence, e -WOM, SEM  INTRODUCTION  Globalization and economic development have led to significant shifts in consumer behavior, manufacturing methods and a revolution in technology, with a large range of internet use and market acceptance (Shao, 2009; Shang, Chen and Liao, 2006;  Schlosser, 2005). Social media has become one of the most effective consumer marketing gears and is increasingly entwined into the normal lives of consumers, changing the way customers and marketers interact with each other (Ismail, 2017). Social media ha s arisen as an electronic communication platform in this scenario by sharing information, ideas and content created by users through networking and blogging (S. Krishnamurthy and W. Dou, 2008). More than 70% of American millennials use social networking ch annels, frequently with several accounts on various sites and smartphone apps (The Nielsen Company, 2015).  Millennials were the first buyers to rise in the world of global interdependence, which made them more open to ethical issues than others (Johnson et .al, 2019). In addition, the childhood years of millennials lead to a rise in media coverage of environmental concern and predisposition (Lu, Bock, & Joseph, 2013). Millennials are thought to be mindful of environmental concerns (Schoolman, Tysman, Schwimm er, & Shriberg, 2016). Millennials are more than just familiar with environmental concerns while creating buying decisions or are mindful ofCSR and resilience. The Nielsen study (2015) has shown that millennials are the most reluctant generation to pay a premium for green items, particularly when produced by companies with positive social 
	 222  and environmental contributions. Furthermore, millennials follow employers that pose simple, optimistic messages about their CSR and environmental initiatives.  Bedard et.a l (2018) has analyzed the motives of millennials to purchase green goods, the use of social media as a marketing tool and its consequences but still there is, however, a gap in a research exploring the role of social media and behavioral regulation by mill ennials as potential drivers of their consumer behavior (Lee, 2008 and 2010; Ellison, Steinfield, & Lampe, 2007). Prusa, P., & Sadílek, T. (2019) have studied the perception of green consumers and presented a model for green consumption.  Analysis into mil lennial consuming patterns is important due to their increased purchasing power and impact of this generation on the total workforce (The Nielsen Company, 2015). Several studies in the past have revealed that social media affects the buying behavior of mil lennials but despite that there is an unwillingness among millennials towards green consumption.  Since more than any other generation, social media is essential for the everyday lives of millennials (Helal et.al, 2018), therefore, the study is required to understand the green consumption behavior and how social media affects it.   Looking at the importance of social media, it is important to understand how social media as a platform shapes young consumers' perception towards eco -friendly products. This study  aims to find the factors shaping consumer perception towards green purchase intention and its subsequent impact on green purchase behavior. The findings of the study would help marketers to frame strategies to motivate millennials towards green products.   Theoretical Background and Hypothesis Development  Social Media Usage and Green Purchase Intention  Singh et al. (2012) stated that social media has pioneered how companies and people connect between green and non -green goods, encouraging consumers to buy m ore engaging and competitive products. Organizations are searching for expanded visibility through various social platforms to reach customers across digital networks. In 2012, Smith and Brower stated that millennials in particular favor green businesses w ith a large web inclusion. Customers mainly use social media to get and ingest product -related information (Heinonen, 2011). Therefore, the online existence of a product is crucial for the final customer buying decisions. Wang et al., (2012) said that inte ractions between social media influence purchasing decisions both directly (by urging buyers to respond to peers) and implicit (by the amount of time spent contemplating and studying a product) . Furthermore, social media experiences are linked positively t o brand faith and product attitude (Wang et al., 2012, Hajli, 2014). Because of the immersive existence of the social media listed earlier (Sonnenburg and Singh, 2012), both corporations and peers networks play a very important role in shaping buying decis ions made by   principle of social influence is used to analyze the use of social media as social media contains an excess of the populated networks, powerful virtual proximities, and content created by the users. Therefore, customers would eventually buil d a trust in a green brand by regular, supportive interactions delivered across social media platforms (Kang & Hur, 2012).So the principle of social influence indicates that the use of social media has a strong effect capacity in a definitive partnership. The above literature has helped us to deduce that social media usage affects purchase intentions and propose the hypothesis that:   H1: Social media usage is positively related to green purchase intentions.   Interpersonal Influence and Green Purchase Inten tion Katz and Lazarsfeld proposed that customers pursue marketing recommendations to satisfy the wish to join a group or strengthen the group relationship
	. It proposed further that opinion -seeking conduct could be studied as a mechanism of socialization (F lynn et al. 1996). Via the cycle of product socialization and contact, opinion seekers may be encouraged to create or reinforce their bonds with the community and gradually become indirectly sensitive to normative influences (Bertrandias, L.; Goldsmith, R. E., 2006). This claim is further reinforced by practical confirmation that interpersonal factors can influence customer buying decisions. Green customers trying to join a green group may demonstrate their desire to buy green goods as a signal that they wan t to adhere to the social expectations set by the green community they want to belong to. 
	 223  Green consumers should therefore be driven to constantly collect renewable information from diverse outlets to select the right products.  This claim is backed by the research by Vining and Ebreo (1990), which found that people who were more dedicated to green habits, such as recycling, were more likely to turn to friends or environmental conservation details than others. Feick et al. (1986) reported that opinion seeker s gather knowledge or views from informal sources to determine goods and make purchasing decisions. Evidence indicates that informative interpersonal factors may affect customer decision -making processes in product reviews, product selection, and purchasin g decisions .Therefore, green customers are extremely likely to rely on climate experts or opinion leaders' knowledge to purchase climate goods in the green sense. In the light of above literature, the hypotheses is proposed:   H2: Interpersonal influence is positively related to green purchase intention .  E-WOM and Green Purchase Intention  Word -of-mouth contact is essentially a message about the product or service of a client, or about the business itself, in the form of feedback about the success of the product, hospitality, integrity, level of operation, and certain issues viewed and encou ntered by someone else. The messages sent may be either positive or pessimistic depending on what the message -giver thinks about the programs it embraces. As mainstream messaging has been phased behind, the shift in messaging paradigms has also shifted cus tomer behavior (Sweeney JC, Soutar GN, Tim M., 2008). Till date, consumers favor word -of-mouth, since the distribution of personal -experience -based information is considered credible. Word -of-mouth contact may have a significant impact on consumers. Wang ( 2015) clarified that EWOM affects consumer purchasing decisions. Lamba et.al (2016) have reported that customer buying decisions were affected by EWOM. With the EWOM, consumers may get a lot more intimacy with other customers and get a quicker response on product information. Where information on products or services is not clear, consumers usually seek more data and citations from other source information, besides official sources of product details. Accordingly, this study considered that the electronic w ord-of-mouth could spread much more information to consumers which further affect the purchase intention. The EWOM affects the purchase intention and is an antecedent of purchase intention. Therefore, we suggest the hypothesis:   H3:  EWOM is positively rel ated to Purchase Intention.   Green Purchase Intention and Green Purchase Behavior  Yadav and Pathak (2017) define intention as the readiness of a person to conduct a specific behavior. As it catches the motivation to act, including readiness to participate and heightened effort, a person is willing to exercise. As per the theory of plann ed behavior, the performance is the product of actions when the action is voluntary in nature. In 2017, Yadav and Pathak, found evidence of a strong correlation in the context of green products for both behavioral intentions and green buying behavior. Cons umers who are highly involved have to make a deliberate purchase without condition (Sharma and Joshi, 2017: Jain and Chamola, 2019). Green purchase intention defined as the want of customers towards acquisitions of green products. Intentions describe the d riving factors that influence green buying behavior among consumers. According to the research by (Richa. C & Samrat. B, 2018) green purchase intention facilitates green purchase behavior in a positive way. Since intention facilitates the purchase behavior s.  Therefore, it is taken as antecedent of purchase behavior and the following hypothesis is proposed in support of the literature.   H4:  Green Purchase Intention affects green purchase behavior positively.   Conceptual Framework  This paper has developed a framework to understand the green purchase intention of millennials
	.  The variables were identified based on literature and are important in predicting green purchase intentions. The variables selected for the framework are: Social Media Usage, Interpers onal Influence, E-WOM, Green Purchase Intentions and Green Purchase Behavior.  
	 224   Figure 1: Conceptual Framework   METHODOLOGY         The present study has undertaken quantitative analysis on collected data. The pilot study had been administered with a samp le of 50 respondents.  Items were developed using existing literature for three constructs and existing scales for purchase intention and behavior had been borrowed. The questions were finalized after ensuring quality and objectivity of the instruments. Th e questionnaire was developed to test the propounded hypothesis.    The systematic random sampling was used to collect the data. Data was collected from students, working professionals and housewives in different parts of the country. The data were collected in the month of January and February, 2020. Total 500 respondents  residing across India have answered the questionnaires.   The summary of respondents‘ demographics is given in Table 1.   The Instrument  The existing scales have been designed to capture the constructs taken in the study. Previous studies conducted in similarcontexts have been made for selection of these scales.  Likert scales were for measurement of data. The questionnaire was composed of two parts.   Demographic details were given in the first section and second sections contains 21 items used to measure the five constructs except EWOM, all constructs were captured using four items scale. To measure social media usage, interpersonal influe nce and EWOM, items were developed after going through literature and in consultation with domain experts. The scales have been improved to ensemble the context and some of the items of the scales have been deleted due to low factor loadings.

Source: Authors‘ Calculations   Structural Equation Model  The SEM bond regression and confirmatory factor analysis to measure a series of interrelationship between constructs of the proposed model. Measurement model and Structural Model are two main elements of SEM. The relationship of latent const ructs to its variable is measured by measurement model whereas structural models examine the power of the relations. It also tests the strength of the relationships.   The Measurement Model  The confirmatory factor analysis has tested the proposed model. In SEM, before proceeding for relationship testing in the constructs, the model is supposed to have high degree of validity and reliability. The hypothesized model has been tested with the help of scales mentioned in the instrument sections.  Total 21 items h ave been used to measure five constructs in the model. The proposed model has been measured using scales mentioned in the Instrument section.   The convergent validity, discriminant validity and reliability have been checked for the proposed model. Interna l consistency is a measure of the reliability of diverse survey items that intend to measure the same 
	 226  characteristics. Cronbach‘s alpha indicates inner consistency. The Cronbach alpha score was calculated for each construct and is presented in Table 1. All  constructs are good on reliability.  Social Media Usage, Interpersonal Influence, EWOM, Purchase Intention and Purchase Behavior have the reliability score of 0.85, 0.81, 0.79, 0.91 and 0.79 respectively.   Convergent validity test the amount of commonness  among the indicators of the constructs (et al., 2010). This is assessed by standardized factor loadings which further confirms the worth of indicator variables and confirms its representation of the latent constructs. All observed variables factor loading  falls between 0.69 and 0.93.  It confirms the relations of individual variables to its constructs and therefore, confirms the convergent validity.   This confirms observed variables are acceptable and relate to their constructs. Therefore, convergent valid ity is confirmed.

Further, CFI, GFI, NFI and TLI should be more than 0.9. The RMSEA value must be inferior than 0.08 (Gefen & Stra b, 2000).  Table 4 presents the summary of goodness of fit for measurement models. The respective Chi -square/df, CFI, GFI, NFI, TLI and RMSEA values are 1.90, 0.91, 0.92, 0.93 0.92, 0.93 and 0.037.   Structural Model : To confirm the propounded hypothesis in  the research model, the structural model has been performed using SEM. The values of goodness of fit indices are 1.92, 0.95, 0.91, 0.93, 0.95 and 0.041 respectively. All goodness of fit measures are within the desired range and are accepted. This proves t he validity of the structural model as per the fit indices and allows us to proceed further to test the research hypothesis proposed in our research model.   Table 5 presents the summary of hypothesis testing. The beta coefficient elucidates the contributio n of independent variables towards dependent variables. All hypotheses are found positive in nature. Factors such asSocial Media Usage, Interpersonal Influence, EWOM and Purchase have been found to be significant and have a different beta coefficient. The different factors contribute different weights to purchase intention towards green products.  RESULTS  & DISCUSSION  The proposed structure mirrored the effect of user -generated content on green customer behavior, due to its perceived level of ease of use, perceived utility and perceived feelings associated with social media use. The social media use has been found to be  a significant predictor of purchase intention (β=0.20: p<0.05). Moreover, the present research also considered the effect of the interaction between many variables on the purchasing decisions and advertisement of green goods. The results reflected that whi le green goods purchasing decisions primarily derive from environmental consciousness, there are certain considerations that are considered crucial in deciding the p
	 228  Literature indicates that insightful interpersonal considerations can influence t he decision -making process of customers in product reviews, product selection and purchase decisions.   The impact of purchase intention on purchase behavior is reported significant (β=0.88: p<0.05) in the study.  Researchers found evidence of a strong corr elation in the context of green products for both behavioral intention and green buying behavior. Green purchase intention defined as the desire of customers to purchase green products. Intention means the driving factors that influence green buying behavi or among consumers. As per the researchers, green purchase intention facilitates green purchase behavior in a positive way.   CONCLUSION  The presence of social media has made it an attractive mode of communication for companies. Companies have realized the power of social media as a platform to connect with consumers and promote their goods on social media. Social media holds huge potential for growth in time to come. As social media has become an important mode of connecting with millennials, therefore, it must be utilized to its fullest to leverage its benefits for society. The current paper has studied the role of social media in shaping millennials' purchase intentions towards green consumption.  Shifting behavior towards green consumption practices will help in saving of resources, improving environment and reduction in wastage of resources.    Theoretical Implications  The current study has extended the existing literature by providing valuable insights. The study has explained the role of social media in  shaping green purchase intentions of millennials. Millennials, being a significant chunk of the population, occupy an important role in consumption and have responsibility towards the environment. Therefore, this study has provided the framework needed to  understand the green purchase intentions of millennials.   Managerial Implications  The adoption of green consumption has become imperative to consumers and companies both. Companies should strive through social media platforms as a part of environmental responsibility to create awareness among consumers about green consumption. As most of the consumers are present on the social media platforms. Therefore, the findings of the study would provide insights to companies about how they can use social media pla tforms to encourage green consumption among Indian consumers. Green consumption would be optimized with the increased environmental awareness through social media platforms.   LIMITATIONS & DIRECTION FOR FUTURE RESEARCH          The current study is not free  from the limitations. The sample size used in India is too low to represent the entire country. The large sample size could have been helped towards generalizing the findings to the population. Second, social media habits and consumption varies across cou ntries. As this study has been carried out in India, therefore it requires replication in some other countries before generalizing the findings. The current study has only used three factors that shape purchase intention for green products. The future stud y must extensively use literature to add more factors to this model to enhance their understanding towards how green intentions are shaped, future studies must segregate the sample according to generation because all generations are different from each other with respect to social media usage.

Keywords :  Impulsive Buying Behavior, Facebook, Social Media Video Advertisements   INTRODUCTION  In the recent times social media has become a predominant tool in influencing the buying behavior of consumers. Specifically, it has transformed customers‘ thinking pattern to a great extent (Mir and Zaheer, 2012). Social media acts as a common platform fo r individuals globally to connect with each other and provide data as well as experiences related to issues, activities and products (Heinrichs et al, 2011). People are influenced by fast growth of social media like Facebook, twitter and so on and as a res ult, firms are actively adopting them as advertising partner as well as activities of building brand (Georgios and Sergios, 2014). It permits firms to communicate with consumers with rapid reach using richer media. Such interactive way of communication amo ng consumers permits to share and exchange data from the advertisers side as well as from consumers‘ side. Firms have the chance to change association with consumers from dialog to trialogue, whereas consumers contribute in remarkable association with firm s and one another (Lipsman et al, 2012).  With the help of social media firms had potential to build links with new and existing consumers and shape communities which interactively work together for identifying issues and developing solutions for them.   Seung (2012) identified that businesses adopt Facebook for building discussion associations with their loyal consumers, encourage their consumers to shop online as well as depend on their consumers for assisting to promote the brand through their involveme nt to Facebook and page given for brand. Some ad types are adopted in Facebook for obtaining high profit namely Facebook power editor, partner categories and more. Buying behavior of customer is integration of decisions, choices and perspectives while purc hasing a product (Perera and Sutha, 2018)
	. Factors influence the consumers buying behaviour are social factors like family, reference group, status and role, culture factors like social stratum, subculture, culture, personal factors namely career, age, life style, economic status, career and self -
	 232 concept and psychological factors like attitude, belief, sensory, motivation and learning (Satrianaa, 2014).    Traditional medium for media communication was believed to be more vital for past few years whereas in  recent year‘s social media has become significant communication mode in advertising and marketing to build brand sustainability. Social marketers communicate and interact effectively and economical to consumers by adopting the mechanism of channels in the  social or digital media. Because of popularity and growth of such media, marketers are giving data and campaigns for advertisement to their consumers by adopting digital innovation (Moreno et al, 2017). With the growth of novel channels in social media the conventional electronic and print media such as newspapers, magazines, television, billboards, hoardings are facing difficulties. With the introduction of new media for interaction has developed novel chances for advertising scopes for marketers and busi ness. Social media plays a vital role in marketing and advertising the products which highly influence consumers to buy products (Seung, 2012). Thus, this particular research intends to concentrate on examining in detail about role of Facebook video advert isements in influencing the impulsive buying behavior of consumers.   Following are the questions to be answered in this research: What are the various aspects related to impulsive buying behavior of consumers? How to develop a model for examining the role of Facebook video advertisements in influencing the impulsive buying behavior of consumers? What are strategies to be adopted for enhancing role of Facebook video advertisements in influencing the impulsive buying behavior of consumers? Aim of the research  is to examine about role of Facebook video advertisements in influencing the impulsive buying behavior of consumers.   There are also researchers and studies which focus on impulsive buying behaviour of customers (Abbasi, 2017, Ahmad et al, 2019, Akram et al, 2018, Al -Zyoud, 2018, Amos et al, 2014, Badgaiyan and Verma, 2014, Farid and Ali, 2018 and Chen et al, 2019). Authors also focused on effect on social media marketing on impulsive buying behaviour in online platform (Bansal and Kumar, 2018 and Chuah and Gan, 2015). Das et al (2018) studied about effect of socioeconomic makeup of users in facebook on purchasing behaviour. Apart from these Dinesh and Bhoopathy (2019) examined about factors that influence impulsive buying behaviour with respect to Millenni al consumers with respect to online platforms. Additionally, Handayani (2019) carried out a research to study about link between browsing of the product on shopping motivation and Instagram and its impacts on purchase intention. There are no studies and researchers that focused on role of facebook video advertisements in influencing the impulsive buying behaviour of consumers with cognitive and affective aspects as well as focus on demographic variables. Therefore this particular research attempts to bridge  that gap by exploring role of facebook video advertisements in influencing the impulsive buying behaviour of consumers with cognitive and affective aspects as well as focus on demographic variables like age, gender, social status and family size   LITERAT URE REVIEW  Social media  Social media assists people to sustain their existing links with family, friends and relatives and communicate with them with rapidity and ease. Functions of social media are categorized in different method with particular function. Social media allows the  companies to directly interact with their consumers. Such strategy allows the customers to feel comfortable than conventional methods of advertising and selling. It allows the people to post comments on goods and share information (Hajli, 2014). When mess age is passed by different people of social media it becomes viral and reaches huge population of people
	. It assists marketers to know about their consumers by knowing their dislikes and like.   It assists different companies for understanding how various kinds of activities are performed. It maximizes awareness for customers how to adapt branded services and products. Social platforms assist to help existing customers and also attract new custome rs (Zembik, 2014). Social media marketing could be adopted in different levels namely organizational level, intra -organizational level and individual and community level. It was clear that these levels 
	 233 effectiveness relies on co -ordination of few factors, health care sectors, governments and policy makers that are efficient and act as basis for campaign of coherent communication (Hristodoulakis et al, 2015 and Bhattacharyya and Roy, 2016).   Introduction to Impulsive Buying Behavior:  Choudhary (2014) refers  impulsive buying as acquisition or buying of products on impulse rather than from premeditation. Impulsive buying is also known as unplanned decisions to buy any merchandise or service. Impulsive buying is an unplanned shopping performed in reaction to an  external trigger. Impulse purchasing emerged upon exposure or by viewing the product to a well -planned promotional message which may be impacted by traits faced by environmental or internal states of customers.   The internal states and environmental cues  perform better to trigger the impulse of customers to buy. Lu and Su (2018) has mentioned that the behaviour that occurs due to buying impulse resulted from product attraction which is hasty, not planned, irrational and thoughtless buying behavior is referred as impulse buying behaviour. It is the buying behavior much of emotions rather than irresistible drives and rationality. Farid and Ali (2018) has stated that impulse buying behavior is an appealing perspective of customer behavior for firms because customers end up purchasing greater than what they have actually planned for. Impulsive buying behavior is becoming the latest trend in nowadays world.   Singh and Tandon (2016) have stated that impulse purchasing behavior is a spontaneous or unplanned buying . One who intends to make such buying is known as impulse buyer. Vasanthi and Deepa (2016) defined impulse buying as a spontaneous or unplanned buying. Impulse items can be a new sample, products or well -established goods at surprisingly reduced costs. Cus tomers who have no preplanning to buy a product have to view the product and decide to purchase the product. Thomas et al (2018) in their study has defined impulse buying as an immediate and sudden buying with no pre -shopping intentions either to purchase the particular category of product or to satisfy a specific purchasing task. Impulse buying behavior exists after facing an urge to purchase and intends to be spontaneous without several reflections.   Similarly, Mainali et al (2016) has stated that impuls e purchasing is an instantaneous and spontaneous buying where the customer is not involved actively in search of a good and has no appropriate pre -mindset to buy. Impulse buying is much emotional than rational. Thompson and Prendergast (2015) have stated that impulsive buying is a spontaneous buying or taking product ownership without any deep thinking. People who are highly involved with impulse purchasing are the ones who get connected emotionally to product easily and are the ones who tend to be fulfille d with on the spot product. Ozer and Gultekin (2015) has mentioned that people who have positive mood are probable to chose for impulse purchasing and tend to be much excited about online shopping compared to negative mood people.   Impact of Social Media Video Advertisement on Impulse Buying Behavior of consumers:  Bansal and Kumar (2018) proposed a study on the social media marketing role and their effect on impulsive buying behaviour. Unplanned buying enhances due to marketing of social media and additional expenses due to factors of social media. Similarly, in Al -Zyoud (2018) study the factors influencing social media are hedonic motivation, trust, website quality and variety seeking. The results of Akram et al (2018) ensure positive impact of situational factors on online impulse purchase among the online shoppers  in social commerce surroundings. Chen et al (2019) study results urge to purchase impulsively is decided by affective trust in recommender and affection towards the suggested product which are impacted by both recommender and product related signals
	.   The study of Sharma, Mishra and Arora (2018) examines the impact of social media advertisement and social media community on impulse purchase intention. The study shows essential relationship among different factors that impact impulse buying behaviour of co nsumers with indices of adequate model fit. Chitharanjan (2016) has found in their study that if business requires impacting the customer behaviour towards their services 
	 234 and products, they have to undertake their ads using channels of social media.   Kazi  et al (2018) studied the impact of social media on impulse purchasing behaviour of consumers and also examined the essential factors influencing impulsive purchasing behaviour of consumers. The results of the study showed that social media have essential and positive effect on consumer‘s impulse purchasing behavior. Husnain et al (2016) found in their study that online social communication can strongly develop the buying behavior of customers on impulse when individual shows the traits. Similarly, in the r esearch of Wahab et al (2018) the motivation of online buying on hedonic motivation has essential impact on impulsive purchasing and browsing of products. Shafique et al (2015) has mentioned in their research that trust plays an essential part on the buyin g decision of online and offline impulse buying.   Kumar and Kaur (2018) investigated the factors influencing the online impulsive buying behavior of customers. The possibility of customers to purchase impulsively is recommended to enhance further because of online shopping convenience. The outcomes of the research will be useful for online organizations which need to enhance the online impulse purchasing behavior of customers. Similarly, Badgaiyan and Verma (2014) examined the impact of personality, materi alism, culture, tendency of shopping enjoyment and impulsive purchasing tendency on impulsive purchasing behavior. Chuah and Gan (2015) examined whether the emotions, hedonic motivation and personality impact impulse purchasing behavior when shopping throu gh internet. Ahmad et al (2019) has mentioned in their study that consumers have greater self -esteem level which tends to imagine twice before buying anything as they are confident about their personality and decisions.   The study of Handayani (2019) dete rmines how hedonic motivation and utilitarian motivation impact buying intention, impulse purchasing, intention of word of mouth and how social media browsing of information impact on hedonic and utilitarian motivation. Based on the outcome the attitude of  searching beauty products has a positive impact on buying motivation. Utilitarian motivation has a positive impact on buying intention but does not have a positive impact of impulse purchasing and WOM intention.   Conversely hedonic motivation has a posit ive impact on WOM intention, impulse buying and buying intention.  In the study of Sebayang et al (2019) hedonic motivation has an essential impact on impulse buying. Similarly, Yu et al (2018) has mentioned that hedonic shopping values are impacted by construct of entertainment and utilitarian values of shopping are positively associated to selection, convenience and monetary saving. Lo et al (2016) has stated that sales promotion stimuli facilitate online impulse buying effectively and provides hedonic or  utilitarian advantage to customers.  Kathiravan et al (2019) has mentioned in their study that the buying behavior understanding of online consumers as far as their impulsive conduct would be helpful for academicians and advertisers.   The main purpose of  this study is to consider a gender at components which strives for internet shopping and to construct a comprehension of variables influencing internet shopping by customers. Kumar and Narayanan (2016) study determines the shoppers impulse buying behavior  at clothing multi brand shops using retail categories and socio -economic factors. Similarly, the study of Das et al (2018) aims to set up whether the Facebook users‘ socio -economic factors has a different impact on their purchasing decisions after exposin g to advertisements on it.   Zhou and Gu (2015) has stated that shopping circumstances and personal qualities influence option of customer impulse purchasing behaviour during promotion of sales. When implementing a reduction of cost, retailers tend to favou r one practice over the other yet, how varied implementations of a cost promotion impact impulse purchasing behaviour of customer has been learnt inadequately
	. This study framed a reduction of cost in the money amount versus products percentage to examine how the expected regret impacts likelihood to impulse purchasing. The study of Huang and Esterhammer (2017) found which factors contribute to the regret feeling during impulse buying.  Tang and Hao (2017) predicted that promotion of price will essentially impact 
	 235 impulsive purchasing behaviour of customer and utility of transaction had a partial mediating impact between impulsive purchasing and promotion of price.   Triwidisari et al (2017) determined the impact of using Instagram social network and motives of hedonic shopping to impulse purchasing media and to know whether financial literacy is capable to moderate the impact of Instagram social network use and motive s of hedonic shopping to impulse purchasing. The motives of hedonic shopping and Instagram social media usage have significant and positive impact to impulse purchasing behavior of students. Financial literacy moderate the impact of Instagram social media use to impulse purchasing while not able to moderate the impact of hedonic shopping motives on impulse purchasing. Ustanti (2018) had mentioned in their research that hedonic shopping essentially impact on impulse purchasing behavior of middle class societ y in internet shopping. Lins et al (2014) has stated in their research that hedonic shopping is positively associated to impulse buying tendency.    Ling and Yazdanifard (2015) studied the online impulsive purchasing behavior causes which are essential as such research may produce some creative strategies or notions to marketers to enhance profit from online market. In this research the authors uses external and internal factors in studying the impulsive purchasing behavior. The internal factors and externa l factors which cause impulsive buying are interrelated in some perspectives and are difficult to isolate individually. Sahai et al (2019) has stated that a positive correlation was viewed between psychological perception of customers and their desire to p urchase online. Fioretti (2018) examined the internal factors, product category and situational factors within customers than can influence impulse purchase. Amos et al (2014) viewed at the effect of outside events or situations on impulse buying and predi cted that positive social impact can enhance impulse purchasing. Khorrami and Esfidani (2015)identified the impact of situational factors on compulsive buying and impulsive buying.   Dinesh and Bhoopathy (2019) have mentioned in their research that markete rs are viewing into the behavior to enhance the online sales. Number of users influencing and/or accompanying during impulse buying and huge amount of income at the initial stage of moth are certain factors that impact impulsive purchasing behavior though the effect is not that essential marketers must view into quantifying variables using big data to perceive the factors better. Singh (2018) has mentioned in their research that high -income group involve in much impulse purchasing than low income group. Lun iya and Varghese (2015) have mentioned in their study that impulse buying behaviour of people increases with the increase in their income.

Products with low involvement have unique impact on consumption pattern of people instead of products with high involvement  2 Coley and Burgess, 2003  Affective aspects  It is related to moods, feelings and emotions. Consumption of products is processed when a customer feel variance in their actual being state and desired one. 3 Hoch and Loewenstein, 1991  Impulse buying behavior  Open buying of products by peoples without explicit intentions to buy or prior planning is very significant for companies.   RESEARCH METHODOLOGY  Paradigms of the research are categorized into different types namely interpretivism, positivism, pragmatism, critical paradigms, M: Demographic characteristics   Age  Gender   Social Status   Family size   Impulsive buying behavior of consumers   Cognitive aspects   Affective aspects  Facebook video advertise -ments  
	 238 subjectivism (Patel, 2015). In this study, investigator adopts the positivist paradigm, since the proposed work examined the r ole of Facebook video advertisements in influencing the impulsive buying behavior of consumers. Positivism paradigm was adopted since this research analyzes the quantitative way of approach. Positivist paradigm has tools to gauge the events, facts and info rmation. Design of the research helps investigator to make research effectively by giving more amount of information with lesser quantity of effort, time and money. This research makes use of descriptive research as the design of the research. This researc h numerically tests the role of Facebook video advertisements in influencing the impulsive buying behavior of consumer. The sampling methodology is generally adopted by investigator to choose desired samples of study.  Sampling methods are mostly probabili ty sampling and non -probability sampling methods. This particular research makes use of simple random sampling methods. Each respondent are selected randomly that is they are selected by a chance and it is also named as probability sampling.   The sample s ize of the study for quantitative approach of the research is 324 consumers. The target population is the group of respondents chosen by the investigator to carry out the investigation to gather primary data. In this research, the selected respondents are consumers to study about their impulsive buying behavior in social media.   Data for this research could be gathered in 2 ways namely secondary and primary data. Primary information of the research are directly gathered from respondents where as the seconda ry type of data are gathered from prior resources. In this research, survey methods were used for collecting the primary data. In this research, investigator would give closed end questionnaires to collect data from the selected participants.

Discussion, managerial implications and limitations of the study:  The current papermakes an effort to identify that there is a  strong association between the attractiveness factors of social media particularly Facebook advertising with impulsive buying behavior processes. The findings of the test of hypothesis is summarized below :  Table 10: Findings of the Test of Hypothesis   S. No Hypothesis  Accepted/  Rejected  1 There is a relationship between the Facebook, social media advertisement and impulsive buying behaviour   Accepted  2 Family size moderates the relationship between the Facebook, social media advertisement and impulsive buying behaviour   Accepted  3 Social status moderates the relationship between the Facebook, social media advertisement and impulsive buying behaviour   Accepted  Role of Facebook advertisement in impulsive buying behavior  Businesses are changing their marketing techniques and practices towards social media for advertising their products and services. Of these, video advertisements are one of the thriving platforms of social -media marketing (Niazi, et al 2012). As a consumer, employing online medium for several reasons in daily life has become quite normal. Marketers are as well accepting this change and implementing required activities in advertising and promotional strategies. The main goal of company/organization is to get through to potential consumers and creates influence on their purchasing behavior (Ayanwale et al., 2005).  According to Adelaar et al. (2003) purchasing behavior is generated by emotio nal response factors, which include pleasure, arousal and excitement. Accordingly in social media video advertisement, the three abovementioned factors are influencing the purchasing behavior of customers (Niazi, et al 2012) and also emphasized that one of  the important reasons of the social media marketing continues to develop is that contrary to other channels of advertising, it brings an opportunity to companies to promote their products & services in a variety of formats tailored to their resources and demands.   Customers who spend a lot of time, effort and money into a buying process might face cognitive element on whether a perfect choice has been made (Kotler and Armstrong, 2014). This makes the customer look for loyal information to lessen the diffe rence, by either confidently authorizing the decision made, or determining that it has been a reckless decision. When the question was asked to respondents whether social media video advertisement influences their purchasing behavior, the majority of respo ndents reported sometimes and others posited yes and hardly a few respondents said yes.  In the current study, respondents were asked to rate their perception in terms of cognitive and affective aspects as well. 43% of respondents disagreed to the point th at they think carefully before they buy something. Similarly, the mediating impacts of internal state of both affective and cognitive -based aspects for the impact of stimuli and the buying intention are exhibited in various experiential studies (Chang and Chen, 2008). Regardless of the recognition of 
	 241 the cognitive aspects, customers do not always act so sensibly throughout their consumption activities; moderately, their satisfaction as well is based on a sequence of affective experiences which are partially  intuitive and automatically created, and do not necessitate complete information processing. The online stream -video commercials are developing as the most important category of online advertisements. YouTube‘s True -View in -stream video commercials seem t o have been successful in considerably lessening the negative user influences of online advertising without negotiating the value of such commercials to advertisers (Pashkevich et al., 2012). Comparatively, online video advertisements give the advanced lev el of brand/product recall and congeniality than that of TV commercials. Intrusiveness can be considered as the core of potentially inimical advertising effects. Besides, intrusiveness would have major destructive effects on attitude and buying intention. In the online platform, on account of customers‘ greater goal -related focus (Goodrich, et al 2015), longer video ads will hold a customer off from his or her aspiration for a longer period, possibly intensifying feelings of intrusiveness and optimistic beh aviors toward the ads.   Relationship between income and affective and cognitive aspects  Remarkable growths in individual disposable incomes and access to credit have made impulsive buying in retail contexts. Vohs and Faber, (2007) emphasized that the characteristics of customers and their demographics factors particularly income impact the impulse purchasing. From a socioeconomic perspective, people with comparatively low levels of income are likely to take pleasure in immediate indulgence as against dela y-of-satisfaction (Muruganantham and Bhakat 2013) and also emphasized that increased income, lifestyle and easy access to credit have made impulse buying an extensive occurrence across the various retail systems.  Only 37% of the respondents agreed that th eir most of their purchases are planned in advance and 27% of the respondents agreed the term. Most of the consumers make the purchase eventually once they seen the online video advertisement (Alijani et al., 2010). Also, it has been emphasized that subjec tive variables, such as entertainment and information, has a positive effect on behavior towards online video commercials (Lee et al., 2011). According to (Taylor, et al 2011) video advertising in social media has the positive impact on the purchasing inte ntion of consumers. The findings of the study emphasized that income acts as a moderator on the relationship between affective and cognitive aspects.   Managerial implications  This study has given the academicians, practitioners, marketers with knowledge about online shopping behavior from customer‘s perspective. Although this study‘s concentrate were mainly on role of facebook video advertisements in influencing the impulsive b uying behavior of consumers, investigator have profoundly focused into cognitive and affective aspects and how they influence consumers through facebook advertisements. This research provides valuable information to companies; marketers like to involve the ir market inside the platforms of social media. At the same time, this research concentrates on business to customer commercial activities like specialists or marketers in social media for advertising their products. Such findings are could be adopted as b asis for set of principles and guidelines when adopting social networking sites more particularly facebook which found to be efficient and effective in the behavior of market.   LIMITATIONS OF THE RESEARCH  Findings of the study are restricted to Facebook video advertisements and this study has been conducted from the perspective of consumers alone. This particular research focuses on the impulsive buying behavior of consumers
	. Categorically, this study is li mited to these demographic aspects namely family size, age, gender and social status. Thus, the outcomes acquired by carried out the survey are constrained by sample size, refer that, our outcomes are not generalized in a large scale.   CONCLUSION AND FUTU RE WORK  Most common usage of facebook across the world has made it valuable and significant platform for advertising where marketers place their advertisement for reaching their valuable customers. Facebook permits businesses and marketers for targeting particular customer as well as encouraging their goods or services through efficient 
	 242 advertisement. From the findings of the research, it was clear that facebook allows the service providers, manufacturers and marketers for reaching consumers of particular g roup of age and interest.  Responses from customers are significant for firms, marketers to influence impulsive buying behavior. Based on the expectations of customers, marketers have to develop more impact on impulsive buying behavior of customers.   The descriptions of impulsive purchasing literature were generally focused on the product whilst defining an impulse buying. The existing studies did not integrate the customer and his individual qualities as the factor impacting impulse purchases. At the time  of impulse buying, the customer experiences an immediate, overwhelming and persistent desire. The research makes an effort to determine if Facebook advertising or other social media advertising is efficient in influencing the impulsive buying and purchasi ng intention of customers. Over the past few decades, two well -distinguished research practices could be observed, i.e. cognitive and affective. An extensive range of experience of customers‘ satisfaction has been developed. The current contribution experi ential research carried out under these two insights to define which components are associated with buying intention, the relationships between the two major approaches. The motivation for this occurrence is to determine how to attribute an interest when i t takes place, as well as and also how to handle advertisements to attract people, based on what kind of activity they wish to take place. Accordingly, this research pays attention to this call and deals with cognitive attitudes, as these have a major impa ct on customer behavior. The findings of the study emphasizes the complication of a model in which cognitive –affective factors are present, and improves knowledge on the effects of perceived interactivity.  Substantial use of Facebook across the world has made it an effective and significant advertising platform, where companies categorize their advertisements to reach and attract their potential customers. Facebook as the platform for viewers provides information, attractive images, videos, etc. Online vid eo advertising generally has the nature of intruding and attracting a human being at times and as well appears in between their goal -directed task and this type of interruption regarded as the perceived invasiveness. To conclude, the study accepted the hyp othesis that there is a relationship between the Facebook, social media advertisement and impulsive buying behavior and as well family size and income moderates the relationship between the Facebook, social media advertisement and impulsive buying behavior .   Further this research exclusively focuses on impulsive buying behavior of consumers. The study therefore could be extended to other social media platforms. It could be examined from the marketer‘s perspective as well in the future in addition to conduc ting a qualitative data analysis as well through collection of detailed view of consumers as well as marketers on social media advertisements and their impact on impulsive buying behavior in the future.

A self -help group is a voluntary association of 10 to 20 women from the disadvantaged section of the population who come together to save and avail credit from microfinance institutions and banks through a facilitating agency such as NGO. This paper reviews the scope and limitations of self-help groups in having an impact on the economic and social upliftment of its members by focussing on an empirical research conducted in the state of Jharkhand and review of existing literature. Majority of available literature focus es on the economic empowerment of women through microfinance intervention with miniscule focus on social empowerment through identified social empowerment variables. This study points out that economic empowerment has not translated into desired social emp owerment for the beneficiaries of this program. The social empowerment of the marginalized is still a mirage. This paper investigates the reason for the same and the role of communication in gender sensitization and stakeholder participation as communicati on is a facilitator of social change. It aims towards understanding the linkage of community participation and communication for empowerment and propose suggestions for the same.   Keywords: Microfinance, Self -help Groups , Communication, Social Empowerment , Economic Empowerment , Community   INTRODUCTION  Initiated as a simple effort to keep Bangladeshi underprivileged women out of the clutches of moneylenders, microfinance has evolved as the twentieth century‘s one of the most radical development intervention. (Chowdhury, Mosley and Simanowitz 2004) .   Microfinance is a non -conventional form of banking focusing on the marginalized category of the society. It is based on the concept that the poor are credit worthy and can pull themselves out of poverty if they have access to affordable loans. Access to credi t facilities has gained attention in reference to the poverty alleviation and empowerment to women (Swain and Wallentin, 2009).   Over the past years many schemes have been introduced by the policy planners which aim at Financial Inclusion.Rural developmen t has been a function of financial inclusion of the vulnerable resulting in self -dependence.   Microfinance has gained importance as a tool for economic development (Aruna and Jyothirmayi, 2011). Women are a significant proportion of beneficiaries.   Tradi tionally, women were not allowed to contribute to economic development. Women are more disadvantaged and have fewer entitlements. They are subjected to greater inequities in the access to food, education, healthcare as well as command over productive resou rces. They have less voice in decision making both in the house as well as the community. As pointed out by Patel and Jha, 2014 women are more likely to utilize their loans for productive purposes hence having a ‗trickling down effect‘. Poor men in rural a reas tend to spend the money on alcohol and other non -necessities. However, the mother always puts her children and family before her and would strive to ensure better food, health, education and standard of 
	   248 living for her children. Hence the impact percol ates to the household and community level.  Microfinance opens opportunities for women to begin their new ventures (Sarumathi and Mohan, 2011). Additional income for the women is added by providing them training, the supply of raw material, marketing platfo rms, and investment or credits. There is a common perception among development planners and academia that economic empowerment automatically translates to social empowerment and increased status of women in the household, enhanced decision -making capabilit y, improved access to health facilities, better education of children and so on. Many studies have shown that although women may be empowered in one sphere, it does not translate into empowerment into other areas. (Kishor, 2000; Kumar 2006) There are numbe r of factors like structure inequalities, gender sensitization, patriarchy, communication loopholes to name a few.   From the existing literature it is observed that studies related to social impact of microfinance is skewed towards the southern and western  states of India. Neither has the impact of communication on the SHG and the community been explored.   Self Help Groups:  A SelfHelp Group is a voluntary association of 10 to20 members (mostly women from similar background) who pool in their financial resources to avail credit from Microfinance Institutions, NGO‘s and Banks. The SHG promotes its members to regularly save small amount of money and then lends this money together with money availed from Bank to the needy members. Each week the members typically contribute around Rs 10 towards the group‘s collection box that represents the group‘s collective savings. These are known by different names in different regions like Mandal, Samiti, Samooh, Sangha and so on. In India SHG‘s are mostly concentrated o n women and the focus is financial credit and savings. (Kumar, 2006)   Concept of Empowerment  Communities have started looking at the women's empowerment as a prerequisite of economic development. Female participation in the economy has become a primary con cern all over the globe (Aruna and Jyothirmayi, 2011).  SHG‘s have emerged as tool of women empowerment. The women who earlier were weak and single entity have gained confidence by being attached to a group. They have obtained relief from evil social custo ms, traditions, prejudices. It has been observed from various studies that empowerment cannot be enforced from the top; it is essentially a bottom -up approach. However, they have to be some handholding from the top.  Empowerment is a multi -dimensional proc ess and has been defined in a variety of ways. The term may be interpreted situationally and contextually. According to Surekharao and Rajamanamma, 1999, empowerment of women helps them to realize their full identity, potential and power in all spheres of life. It consists of increased command over resources, greater access to information, autonomy in decision making, freedom from sudden financial crisis and ability to plan life in general. Empowerment of women is a process in which women can become organiz ed to increase their reliance, rights to make decisions and controlling the resources in hand and eliminating their subordinates (Varghese, 2011). Kabeer (2005) explored and highlighted that although access to financial services does not make a vital contr ibution to economic productivity and social well -being, it does automatically empower women. As per the study conducted by Umashankar, 2006, it was asserted that access to credit resulted in women to become independent. The study further reiterated the fac t that qualitative methods must be given due importance in understanding the role of SHG in women empowerment. Tripathi, 2015 in her study views empowerment as an approach to enhancing individual‘s capacity and skills which leads to greater participation, improved decision making and transformative action
	. She has identified four components of women empowerment, which are psychological, social, cultural and lastly economic and political empowerment.   Communication Approaches by SHG‟s for Empowerment of Wome n Every community project or development program requires effective participation of all stakeholders involved in such project. The communication channels need to open among all participants to keep them abreast of the 
	   249 developments of the program. (Aruma, 20 18). Communication is of paramount importance for exchange of ideas and information especially in community projects. Communication is a process whereby people exchange ideas, thoughts, feelings, views with other people individually or in groups using verb al and nonverbal signs and expression to convey their thought.   Communication is the livewire of our society as it connects individuals to one another, individuals to groups, social organizations, community, villages, towns, societies, government and non -government bodies, religious organizations etc. As pointed out by Obono,(2018) in a study in Nigeria that development communication needs to be dynamic and needs to integrate both traditional and modern channels of communication for effective delivery of message in the society. While selecting the approach to communication factors such as target group, participation, interactivity and accessibility needs to be considered. There is a coexistence of formal and informal modes of communication in rural areas. T hese channels are used to get various social, economic and health related information. A study done by Varma and Verma, (2017) in two rural villages in Rajasthan points out that rural people rely more on informal sources of communication like neighbors, el ders, midwives, chaupal etc. as compared to formal modes of communication like radio, newspaper, dialogue with development officials and information by wall paintings related to health. These informal sources are disseminating a lot of information which th e rural people believe and act upon.   There have been numerous programs for women empowerment and development by the governments. However, most of these projects have failed to deliver the expected outcome as both the parties involved in the process i.e. the program implementers and beneficiaries have not been prepared for the change. There are two types of approached needed to induce change. First is the externally induced change and the other is the change which is induced from within the individual. (Mu rthy et. all, 2010). While externally induced change does not yield long term benefits, the change which is from within and internally motivated brings about an overall change in the attitude and behavior of the individual.   John G and Etika D, (2019) have  studied the effect and relevance of participatory communication in development projects in Nigeria. Participatory communication is a communication approach that brings all stakeholders together and engages them in discussion to address a common societal problem. It stresses that the people and communities should be agents of social change and not just passive beneficiaries of the development initiatives. This approach has been used to enlighten and sensitize beneficiaries and communities to the need of the program even before it has been initiated. Participatory communication firstly requires the change in the mindset of the communicators and stresses on the need to engage people in the planning, decision making and implementation phase of community project s like empowerment of marginalized through SHG‘s. This approach of communication leads to internally induced empowerment as all the stakeholders are involved in sharing of information, dialogue, discussion and opinions and can thereby take informed decisio ns.Unless people themselves are the drivers of social change, no amount of external aid, technology and interventions will bring a change in their standard of living.   Participatory communication has a direct relationship with the access to community media . Community media combines some of the major benefits and strategies of mass media and interpersonal communication. It involves the members from the local community. It is a part of social and behavior change communication (SBCC) approach which involves th e art of storytelling with innovative technologies that can empower communities
	. (Granger et all, 2019). Sharing success stories of SHG members through this medium can yield positive results.   SHG‘s are of paramount importance in community development and women empowerment as they have been able to accomplish the task of coming together and taking collective action for change and empowerment. Community development takes place when a group of people in a community come together with an aim to bring a desirab le and positive change in the 
	   250 lives of its members through the cooperative efforts of these people. The coming together of group members and working towards a common goal requires a precondition of effective communication among them. (Adedokum et all, 2010 ). When people connect with each other at the same level they develop mutual trust for collective action. As pointed out by Murthy et. all, (2010) there are essentially five approaches of communication in SHG‘s according to their stage of development. The first is Two-steps flow of communication whereby information first flows to the influencing individual or opinion leaders in a community. Next this information is transmitted by the opinion leaders to the individuals in the group in the local dialect. In context of SHG‘s the leader is extrovert literate member who usually receives the information from the government officials, bankers or department facilitators and disseminates this information to the other group members.   The next approach of communication  is a Dialogue.  A dialogue is an interpersonal communication process between two individuals like two members of a group narrating their personal experience about the membership of SHG in terms of changes in savings habit, credit provision, personal experi ences within the family etc. Since it is an informal one to one communication, it carries a lot of important information. Since the SHG members are from similar neighbourhood and economic class there is a common base for dialogues. They most often discuss about loan repayment sources, prospects of their ventures, education of children, illness and the like. SHG Sammelan  is the third form of communication. It is an annual gathering of all SHG members to discuss about the group‘s working, the problems encount ered, interactions with outside parties like bankers, NGO facilitators, development officials etc. A sammelan is an important community initiative as it encourages the women to come out of their homes and freely interact with women of different neighborhoo d in that area. There is a feeling of oneness among members and free flow of ideas is facilitated.   An extension of a sammelan is a Community lunch  which is the fourth approach of communication. Community lunches are arranged during sammelans, trainings f or SHG‘s, orientation programs for new members. During community lunches the marginalized women form connections with each other and discuss common problems and solutions to the same. There is a feeling of oneness and community lunches facilities unity wit hin the group. The members also share responsibilities during the arranging of such gatherings resulting in community participation and communication in informal settings. Rural India faces the structural barriers of caste and class. The caste system is the social stratification of people into different social classes and is defined hereditarily by birth. (Kumar A, 2007). Even among SHG member‘s caste hierarchy play a predominant role. Community lunches are an effort to break the formal hierarchy. Preparati on of lunches, tea, clearing and cleaning the place fosters the feeling of group and not caste.   The last approach of communication is the Entertainment – Education Programs.  These types of programs have been used by the government for inculcating awarene ss and educating the rural poor since a long time. The social issues dealt are mostly related to health such as educating about child and maternal health, HIV/ AIDS, small family norms and benefits etc. This approach of communication goes beyond the indivi dual model and affects the community at large. Skits and street plays are organized where the outgoing and extrovert members mostly participate. Social evils such as dowry, alcoholism and domestic violence also form the theme of such plays. The theme of su ch skits is prepared by the SHG members during the Sammelans. Such programs can be a mobilizer of social change in communities
	.   These five approaches of communication within a SHG can be adopted simultaneously to strengthen the group, generate ideas and facilitate flow of information. Communication among the members within the SHG is a prerequisite of developing coordination among them. It enhances psychological empowerment within the group as they have a small group to fall back upon in event of crisis.   RESEARCH METHODOLOGY  The Study – In context of state of Jharkhand  Primary data has been collected through structured questionnaires, focussed group discussions and select case studies among 270 women respondents in the state of Jharkhand 
	   251 which happens to be one of the poorest states in the country. The finding of this study is based on both qualitative and quantitative data which tries to explore the linkages between economic empowerment and social empowerment of women SHG members and the role of communica tion and community participation in empowerment.   Objective of the Study  With the research background in mind, this study was undertaken to determine the functioning of self -help groups in Jharkhand, the channels of communication adopted to strengthen the relationship among members; to determine the economic impact of SHG‘s on its members and to evaluate the social impact of microfinance on its beneficiary clients in terms of decision making, health, empowerment, social networking and communication and cris is management.   The Study Area, Sample and Methodology  The state of Jharkhand has been selected for the study. Jharkhand state has been carved out of Bihar in the year 2000. The state is touted to be loaded with mineral resources but poor in agricultural p roduction. Greater than as much as 75% of the total working people are engrossed in agriculture but generates only 20% of the total GDP of the state. It has a high percentage of tribal population and the region is characterized by extensive forests. The se x ratio is 948 females per 1000 males. The literacy rate is 66.41% with female literacy at 55.42%. The pattern of society is principally patriarchal with a predominance of issues of class and caste. (Chakravarty et. all 2013, Kumar 2007). State wise Jharkh and ranks third with a whopping 36.96 % of its population below poverty line, considering the bountiful natural resources available to the state this is a matter of concern for the government and other stakeholders.( www.r bi.org )  For including respondents from a vast geographically spread population, multistage judgemental sampling technique was used. The state of Jharkhand has five divisions. Two districts from each division have been chosen basis penetration of microfina nce activities and network of well -established NGO‘s. Two blocks have been chosen from each district basis the large number of SHG‘s in these blocks. Three SHG‘s have been chosen from each block considering the age of SHG. Lastly five members have been sel ected from each SHG. These respondents were picked up on the basis of their position in the group, tenure of membership (minimum two years of SHG membership), willingness to discuss and disclose personal mattersand credit history. Hence 270 respondents for med the sample size for this study. Both quantitative and qualitative data has been used for the study. Qualitative data has been gathered by conducting case studies and focussed group discussions to gain an insight into the member‘s perception about their  roles, status, expectations and achievements post SHG period. Interviews with field level officials, male family members, community members were also conducted to understand their viewpoint. This provided an opportunity to gain access and insight into the  community‘s perception about the efficacy and working of SHG‘s.   Economic and Social Impact Variables:  Economic indicators are easier to study as these can be quantified and does not depend upon the individual judgement of the respondents. For this study  four economic variables such as income, savings, assets and insurance has been considered.A major impact of the microfinance intervention depends on the social change in the lives of its beneficiaries. Social variables are difficult to measure as compared  to its economic variables‘ counterpart. The responses are influenced by personal choices and memory recall method. More studies have focused on the economic empowerment aspect and the social aspect is often considered a spill over effect. Therefore, a stu dy evaluating the social empowerment of women through microfinance intervention is considered imperative
	. This research tries to investigate the impact upon the five social variables namely decision making, health and immunization, empowerment, social netw orking and communication and crisis management.   RESULTS AND FINDINGS  Socio Economic profile of Respondents  Majority of the sample in the study belonged to the age group of 31 -40 years, and 86.3% were married women. 63% of the respondents were Hindus follo wed by 16% Christians. Most of the respondents had only a primary level of education, and three percent were 
	   252 illiterate. Agriculture is seen as a significant source of income among the respondents. Monthly household income was around Rs 4500 per month in m ost of the sample.   Impact of SHG‟s on Economic Empowerment of Women  The study has examined the assessment variables at the economic and social level. A pre SHG period and post SHG period data comparison has been done. Questionnaire has been distributed on ly once and pre SHG data has been gathered by memory recall method of respondents.

(Table 1) As evident from Table 2, 25% of the respondents had no savings prior to joining SHG membership followed by 47% respondents having an annual savings of less than Rs 5000. It was observed that savings increased post SHG membership. All respondents developed the habit of savings, as it was mandatory to contribute small amount to the SHG savings fund per month.   33% stated savings more than Rs 5001 and upto Rs 10000 and 30% stated increase in savings to Rs 15,001 and above. 55% of the respondents reported anincrease in their assets and 37% said that there was no change in the assetownership post joining SHG. Majority of the sample stated  that they had no insurance before being a member but growth in the crop and livestock insurance is observed post SHG membership.Overall, there has been betterment in the economic status of the members of the SHG. However, it is to be noted that this advan cement is for the entire household and not only for the member as many a times the credit is taken for the husband‘s entrepreneurial venture, for children‘s education or to meet a family requirement.   Impact of SHG‟s on Social Empowerment of Women  It is ev ident from the table 5 that the membership of SHG has not led to the desired level of social empowerment.

	   254 The extremely important observation is that economicempowerment has not directly translated tosocial empowerment. This contrasts with thestudy by Kumar et all, 2019 which wasconducted across eight districts of five states of central and eastern India. The study states that membership of SHG has a positive outcome on the social variables such as health and nutrition, collective action regarding public entitlements, improved decision -makingsability etc. The presen t study on Jharkhand states that the decision regarding use of borrowed money still rests with the male member of the family. The poor women do not enjoy the spending rights over their own income too. 64% respondents reported no change in decision making a bility with regards to education of children and same was the case with regards to strength to protest social evils (53%). The state of healthcare especially in rural India is still a cause of concern. The awareness related to health and medical facilities  remain dismal. There has not been much improvement in terms of improved sanitation, immunization to children below the age of 10 and safe drinking water. The need of privacy and defecation is greater for girls‘ women than the male family members. The unav ailability of proper sanitation facilities for women is the reason for chronic constipation, urinary infections, improper menstrual hygiene and many other health related issues (Pandya and Shukla,2018). Many cases of improved sanitation were an outcome of government‘s Swaach Bharat Mission and not necessarily as a direct outcome of membership of SHG.However, women do not have much say in installation of sanitation facilities due to power hierarchies existing in the household, socio -cultural constraints and hesitation in communicating personal matters.   Empowerment has been measured by three variables – reduction in domestic violence, purchase of major household items independently, respect in society after being a part of the group. Surprisingly 49% responde nts reported a rise in cases of domestic violence by husband/ in -laws post joining SHG. Although gender equality is a basic development goal across countries, however incidences of violence against women is a pandemic affecting nations worldwide. Women are  treated as second class citizens and such discrimination can translate into obvious societal and structural norms (Pandya and Shukla, 2018). Similarly, the decision regarding purchase of assets/ household items still vests with the head of the family or t he male members of the family. After being a part of the group the interaction of the poor women with outsiders (people other than family members) has improved (64%) They have started interacting with women from the distant neighbourhood, bank officials, f acilitators, etc. However, the improvement is noticed in women who are more mostly leaders/ secretary of the group and are more outgoing. It is based on the positive deviance (PD) approach which suggests that in every group or community there are individua ls whose strategies and uncommon behaviour help them to find innovative solutions to their problems and stand out among the group/ community while facing the same economic and social conditions (Khalid et all, 2019). The women still do not play an importan t role in community decision making. 69% of the respondents have mentioned that they still do not play any significant role in community decisions. Contrary to this there is a marked improvement in use of mobile phones post joining the SHG (68%) The member s get information regarding the meeting, savings and credit of the SHG on mobile phones. Despite being a member of the SHG for more than two years the members still do not have enough confidence to face personal crisis neither do they have the requisite co rpus to help group members in time of emergencies. From these findings it is evident that membership of SHG has resulted in provision of credit and income generating activities but how much this contributed to social well -being and empowerment of women is still a matter of debate and discussion
	.    Findings from Case Studies and Focussed Group Discussions  Case Studies and Focussed Group Discussions were conducted to get a qualitative view into the lives of the SHG members. As Einstein had rightly remarked ― Not everything that can be counted counts, and not everything that counts can be counted‖. Ten women respondents were selected to study their case history. These respondents were picked up on the basis of ease of contact, tenure of membership (minimum thre e years of SHG membership), willingness to discuss and 
	   255 disclose personal matters, position in the group and credit history. These methods gave the authors an in -depthinsight into the women‘s views, perspectives, experiences, family relations etc who otherw ise remain silent and docile. Silence is a protective tool enforced by our patriarchal society that hides so many stories of these women. (Umashankar, 2006). Such personal narratives highlight the difference in expression and experiences of women living in  the same structural context at the same time. The factors that affect such narratives are literacy levels, interpersonal relationships, power structure within the household, socialisation histories, cultural beliefs and relationships with neighbours and e xtended families. (Singh S, 2005).Findings from Case Studies and Focussed Group Discussions suggest that SHG membership has benefitted the underprivileged in many ways. A change of attitude and behaviour is apparent among the members. Participation in inco me generating activities has improved the confidence of the respondents.   There is a remarkable transformation of a local village woman from what she was 10 years back. (Kumar, 2007). There is a desire to excel, to do the best for her family especially children. Although she has a desire to contribute to community development, the existing patriarchy doesn‘t allow her to contribute significantly. The results from the discussions and case studies make us question the gender power relations within the hous ehold and within the community. Western feminism is based on the premise of equality between men and women. The same does not hold true in case of developing countries where women survive in a society and culture which is built on the principle of inequali ty between men and women. The husband and family continue to be the most reliable source of economic, social and cultural support. (Singh S, 2005).There is clear lack of participatory communication which could have led to a social and behavioural change. Although women are participating in community affairs, the percentage is very small.There is a hesitation to communicate with the opposite sex apart from her males of her own family. Poor level of infrastructure and services prevail in the villages and ther e is very less use of technology.   There is availability of credit for income generating activities. However, in cases of medical emergencies, social functions, death in the family and other crisis the women often resort to the local moneylender for immedi ate help. Many a times the credit availed for income generating activity is used for immediate consumption purpose and daily activities like expenses on food, school fees, health etc.   ―Earlier when I needed money I had to beg in front of my husband. He w orks as a casual labour. Some days we didn‘t have the money to feed our children properly. I borrowed money from local moneylender to pay school fees. I wanted to send my children (2 daughters and 1 son) to school so that they could get midday meal at scho ol. Post joining SHG I availed a loan of Rs 3000 and started selling pickles. Within 6 months I had my own steady source of income. Although it is not enough, now I don‘t have to ask anyone for money. I plan to join hands with two other members from my gro up and expand my business‖ (Respondent 64)   The women are burdened with both economic and non -economic activities. They are concurrently engaged in childbearing, childcare, looking after family, elders as well as participating in income generating activiti es thus exerting a greater strain on her own health and wellbeing. Non -economic household work is essentially done by the beti/ bahu . These are unpaid, tiring and unending duties for which they hardly get any recognition and appreciation. Many of the farm activities which are physically challenging and tedious such as transplanting, weeding, harvesting and protection of crops is also done by the woman
	. They also need to take care of the cattle.   Clearly there is a disproportionate division of roles and res ponsibilities. A typical day in the lives of these marginalized women starts as early as 4am/ 5am and ends only at 9 pm with almost no rest in between. This type of physical labour takes a toll on the health of women and there is no relief even during sickness or pregnancy. Many a times the NGO facilitators/ government officials/ bankers do not relate to this type of physical and mental workload. They often categorize the members as non -motivated and indifferent to training programs. In most of the cases th ere is a clear lack of support from husband/ other family 
	   256 members on days when trainings and orientation programs are held. The selection of training is also influenced by the implementer‘s thought of what should be taught. There is a clear lack of sensiti zation of the stakeholders involved.   ―These women are only interested in availing credit and not undergoing training. As soon as they get the money, they use it for consumption purposes. Although some of them are self -motivated and attend the training pro grams, most of them need to be forced to do so. They come late and give excuses. We try to explain to them that theses trainings are for their own benefit.‖ (NGO facilitator)   The empirical data from this study points out that there has been a rise in case s of domestic violence post SHG membership. 49% of women reported an increase in domestic violence whereas 26% reported no change in the current situation. The women have been subjected to domestic violence since time immemorial which has been hidden withi n the four walls of the house. Mostly violence is accompanied by a threat of desertion due to which the victim feels more helpless and is not willing to share her story with others. The scope for bargaining over power is maximum at the household level and goes on diminishing at the institutional and community level. While the physically bruises and wounds slowly become fainter the emotional wounds destroy the very spirit (Umashankar, 2006). Although the woman is an earning member of the family still, she is  quite powerless within her own household. Generally, the woman stays back due to family pressure and for sake of her children. Neither does she have the confidence nor the financial resources to manage on her own.   My husband did not approve of me joinin g any group. He accused me of shoving my household responsibilities and making merry in name of group meetings. He also questions my character. My mother in law instigates him. He beats me at night after drinking and takes away my day‘s earnings. I complai ned to my parents many a times, but they have said that it is the kismat of a woman. They fear that I would leave my husband and become a lifelong burden on them. I don‘t discuss about this with group members as my husband would lock me up and beat me to d eath if he comes to know. (Respondent 19)   Although women have collectively become powerful and have combated certain social issues such as alcoholism, lack of electricity, access to anganwari  services yet many of them are still shy and unwilling to partic ipate in community works. Mutual support among the women is a prerequisite for their empowerment. The effective communication and mentoring of new members by the leader/ veteran SHG member has been extremely helpful.   CONCLUSION  It has been argued by many  researchers that women‘s participation in SHG‘s has resulted in poverty alleviation and socio -economic empowerment of women. Empowerment gains are not an automatic outcome of availability of credit services to the poor. (Kabeer and Noponen, 2005). Althoug h gains in terms of income, savings, and financial literacy skills are evident, impact on decision making ability and involvement in community matters are far from modest. Microcredit has been regarded to fix social challenges and the results of this study  reiterates the fact that SHG and microcredit has not empowered its members socially to the levels expected. The command over resources and decision making still rests with the male member of the family. Although availability of microfinance has reduced th e dependence on informal modes of lending, there is slight improvement in social variables like healthcare. One generation of exposure to credit and income generating activities cannot diffuse the centuries old patriarchy, social and cultural conditioning.  (Osmani, 1998)   The five approaches to communication mentioned above focuses on flow of information among the SHG members
	. It boosts the synergy and bonding between the group members and encourages potential members to join the group. However, it failed to look at the broader picture. SHG operates in a community and the family members, community members, local leaders have not been adequately sensitized on the issue.Sustained improvement in gender relations can be achieved through repeated communication wi th regards to behaviour centred change communication. (Granger et all, 2019)   
	   257 Participatory communication is a salient aspect or approach of communication that fast-tracks development projects. To achieve success requires that priority should be given to t he component of participatory communication when undertaking community projects. Development agencies and change agents should as a matter of fact allocate enormous attention to community involvement/ participation as this is key to the successful completi on and realisation of set goals. Effective communication will help the marginalized to break out of the age -old culture of silence and discuss issues and challenges faced by them (Aruma, 2018). They need to be more assertive and vocal in a community forum.  The important tool of communication should be explored adequately to reach the different sections of the community. A regular and direct communication with the community leadership is necessary.   The social impact of microfinance goes beyond the individu al beneficiary of the program and percolates to the household and then the society. Hence the development planners and stakeholders can focus on strengthening the social aspect of the program. It depends upon the societal structure, existing gender relatio ns and flow of communication to the indirect beneficiaries of the program. The community at large needs to be sensitized towards the poor women. The women have been burdened with the dual responsibility of income generation, childcare and household respons ibilities.  The men especially need to be sensitised on gender equality issues. Here community participation is extremely important for real advancement and empowerment. Development communication needs to address the social and cultural complexities and in clude all groups within the community to address the problem at the grass root level (Obono, 2018)   The microfinance intervention rarely addresses the gender specific issues and lack of mentoring and communication on the same. There are major inequalities and power imbalances between both the genders in society. By advocating a top down approach, the program implementers miss out on the actuality of women‘s lives and the existing power roles in the society. Improper communication leads to absence of partici patory planning and total information regarding the program benefits does not percolate to each member of the group. An examination of the existing gender roles, command over resources, free flow of communication, gender -based division of labour is of para mount importance prior to the implementation of such interventions. The need of the hour is a gender transformative policy and sensitisation and counselling of all family members and community involved.   The communication approaches of SHG‘s such as two flow communication, dialogue, sammelan many a times lack community participation. Trainings are imparted to SHG members for skill development, financial literacy, accounting etc. However, it can also be the male trainer who firstly needs to be mentored to change his preconceived notions regarding the poor women. There is also a need to sensitize the facilitators, policy implementers, local leaders and male family member on gender specific issues. This can be a highly sensitive task and can hurt the ego of the male stakeholders involved. Hence the communication needs to flow in the appropriate manner and from a person who is looked upon by others. There needs to be a change in behaviour of not only the male member but also other elderly women in society who s upport such patriarchal structure in society. Public perceptions and awareness need to be altered to provide a supportive environment at the community level.   This study concludes that solutions such as microfinance and SHG‘s which emerge from internationa l policy circles need to consider the local structural issues to maximise their results. This study has focused on certain specific social impact variables of microfinance; future work can be conducted on a set of comprehensive variables
	. Also, it is suggested to conduct a similar study on the other tribal areas of India and compare its impact .   REFERENCES  Adedokun M.O., Adeyomo C.W., Olorunsal E.O.

Cyberspace is not entirely new to the world of entertainment, but its entry into sacred spaces, where sheer rules control the community, is invi ting the concerns of the priestly communities. The virtual world created with the help of technology has begun to affect the approaches towards pilgrimages. The impact may be perceived to be adverse or favourable depending upon the varied perspectives. Thi s simulacrum of pilgrimages allows enormous freedom to the pilgrims presenting them with a customized to be more real pictures of the houses of worship. The virtual world is more persuasive in comparison to the world we live in, as this cyberworld, unlike the world of restrictions and virtues, discourages the self -denial and persuades the subject to be more indulged into it considering it a replacement. It can prevail on the subject only through its more appealing truth -like imaginary (but not in all cases)  pictures. Thisresearcharticle is intended to discuss and assess the impact of the entry of the cyberspace into the sacred space over the religiosity of the communities in India. The paper further examines the complementarity offered by these two spaces fo r each other.   Keywords : Virtual Reality, Religious Communities, Cyberspace, Digital Content .  INTRODUCTION  A simulated world, no doubt, has an appeal for millions of people around the globe, especially forentertainment in leisure and specific mental exercises, but whether these simulacra of sacred spaces are complementing the pilgrimages or substituting them, w ill be discussed in the article. The discussion in the article encompasses assessing the influence of the computer -interceded environment over the religiosity of people in India. It not only focuses on the ‗virtual reality,‘ in terms of computer -mediated e nvironment, but also refers to the simulation of reality created with the help of technology other than computer, and fictionality. Patrick Maxwell, talking about online religious possibilities, says, ―Imagination, visualisation, magic, and metaphor can be  interwoven in the experience of today‘s cyberspace traveller, and all of them are obviously relevant to religious possibilities online‖ (2002:345).   Simulation of religious space is not strictly confined to the immersive experience instead, it encompasse s a wide range of contents that have been helping the pilgrimages in enlightening and attracting the prospective pilgrims through sophisticated picture galleries, historical accounts, and some other tourist attractions nearby.JurajSkačan, talking about thi s phenomenon, notes, ―The issue of virtual reality has been playing an ever more existential role in the lives of individual people and society as such. Bearing in mind Jean Baudrillard ‘s theory of simulacra, we do not want to be limited to viewing virtual  reality as defined in most dictionaries and encyclopaedias, i.e., as an alternative three -dimensional world generated by computers. Instead, our broader concept based on media theories includes any depiction of reality by the media.‖ (2017:20). This pheno menon of immersive experience in terms of religious places is comparatively new that somehow is creating prospects and challenges both to the pilgrimages.   Talking about the impact of cyberpilgrimages, Hill-Smith says, ―The online ‗virtual world‘ game Sec ond Life offers numerous cyberpilgrimages, allowing users to broaden
	 
	   261 their knowledge and experience of religious traditions virtually; and public panorama technologies such as Google Street View are also embracing pilgrimage ‗markets‘. This highly contempo rary expression of the pilgrimage tradition is attracting interest from diverse traditions, increasingly altering the way that faith communities express and experience religiosity.‖ (2011:236). This computer -mediated simulation of pilgrimages grants enormo us freedom to the pilgrims by customizing spaces as per their needs. Saied Reza, in this regard, notes, ―The virtual space overcomes the limitation of time and place, and makes parallel interaction possible, since religiosity in different places and times comes true for religious people, and the noted limitation would be minimized or removed.‖ (2009:221). The article further argues how this alternate intercession of a virtual world may initially attract people towards it as a substitution to the actuals. Su bsequently, it cannot sustain to serve the purpose of religion in the lives of people, particularly in the case of a country like India, where the religio -cultural identity secures a primal place.   RESEARCH METHODOLOGY  The methodology followed in conductin g research for this article includes certain sub -genres of qualitative content analysis, like analysing media content, netnographic analysis, and the analysis of the previous literature available. Further, the research was executed through secondary resear ch mixed interpretative methods through the use of scholarly literature to ascertain the main themes that present themselves in the article. For evaluating contents available on the websites, this research will depend on ‗netnography‘, a naturalistic metho d for interpretation with a combination of elicited and non -elicited data available online without being visible to cultural members (Kozinets et al., 2014:263). This article being interpretative is grounded, as stated earlier, in qualitative research, whi ch seeks to bring forth affective intensities permeating through contemporary houses of worship and their functions.   Virtual Religious Spaces: Virtually Real or Truly Real  Discussing about the virtual pilgrimage MacWilliamscites Shawn Wilbur, ―What is a ‗virtual pilgrimage‘? Shawn Wilbur has noted that ‗virtual‘ typically means something that appears to be but is not real, authentic, or proper. It is important to note that some virtual pilgrimage sites fit this definition. They are informational only, desi gned to provide clever simulations or representations for instructional purposes.‖ (2002:317). Here, MacWilliams primarily refers to those websites and webpages that are used for promotional purposes. But if we talk exclusively about the immersive virtual space, in some cases, tampering with the recordings of the actual space for creating simulation is considered to be a violation and may cause the loss of faith of pilgrims in this platform.   To understand it further, let us examine ‗virtual reality‘ from the point the word ‗virtual‘ was used for the first time. It was primarily used in the context of imitation of reality on stage, a theatrical performance, which essentially is an amalgamation of fact and fictionality. Literary productions take an audience/ spectator with its flow to live in the world created by it, which is neither virtual nor real but a concomitance of the two. However, the audience knows that the film/drama being shown is not real, yet he suspends his disbelief to enjoy the world that resembles his and laughs and cries with pleasures and pains of that world during the time he is involved with the performance.   Talking about the attainment of the enormous popularity of virtual reality, Robin Kabha cites Jurgenson (2011), ―The concept of vir tual reality reached enormous popularity with the advent of a science fiction movie called ―The Matrix,‖ in which the characters resided in a completely virtual world simulated to such precise levels that it was identical to the real world and the characte r being totally unaware of this
	. This movie introduced the concept of virtual reality to a massive audience and had a significant cultural impact which still resonates in the contemporary world.‖ (2019:42 -43). Virtual reality or VR is widely known as a com puter -mediated simulation of reality that projects fictional and physical environments as if real. When a spectator wears the VR headset, he, with the projected environment, gets transported to a supra -real world that he finds in front of his eyes being projected through that machine. And, to enjoy, or to be involved with this supra -real projection, one has to estrange one‘s cognitive critical faculty and start believing without any 
	   262 kind of doubt in what is being shown. Here Coleridge‘s conception of ―willi ng suspension of disbelief‖ becomes more relevant and meaningful to enjoy this virtual world.  Questioning the entity of this world may spoil all its attraction and purpose. So, immersing in this virtually real world, one should forget the actual, and enjo y its created beauty.   This paper not only concentrates on computer -mediated virtual reality but also takes into consideration the reality that is virtual in a literal sense and is produced with the help of technology and imagination. Here, the focus is also centered on an aspect of simulation of reality where virtual reality is presented to be more real than the truly real by adding creativity.   The term ‗Virtual Reality‘ came into existence or in vogue only after it was used in the context of literature  or fiction. Antonin Artaud, a French dramatist, poet, and theatre director, used this term in the context of characters and other objects used in theatre, which are unreal. Hereafter, the term was frequently used in the context of fiction, from where it r olled down to its present area, identity, and meaning. Virtual reality works on the principle of exclusion from the source environment. This exclusion sometimes is mere exclusion, and sometimes a replacement of harsh by mild, or sour by sweet though false to please the audience because its success very much depends on the liking and disliking of the people viewing it. And, it is for the sake of pleasing the spectator; therefore, in VR contents, all kinds of things which are more appealing are added.   About  virtual, Gilles Deleuze, who is also known as the philosopher of virtual, in one of his most famous books, ‗ Bergsonism ‘ writes, ―A philosophy like this assumes that the notion of the virtual stops being vague and indeterminate. In itself, it needs to have the highest degree of precision‖ (1988:94). The point being made here is that virtual doesn‘t mean unreal, only it is n ot actual. Deleuze‘s explanation of virtual goes along with Bergson‘s understanding of the term. Bergson sees virtual as a part and real as the whole. Today‘s meaning of the term has deviated a lot from Deleuze‘s idea of the word, which he expounded in his  books. Keith Ansell Pearson in this context writes — Today, however, the notion is widely treated in imprecise and ill -defined terms, namely, as all the other stuff that is not actual, something like the Universe in its totality and unfathomable complexity . It requires a pluralist ontology since one can speak of diverse modalities of the virtual, even though one is, in fact, speaking of a being of the virtual: for example, one can speak of the virtual or partial object, of the virtual image, virtual memory,  and so on (2005:1113).   So, the digression in meaning of the term is criticized by Pearson keeping in view the propositions of Deleuze and Bergson. This term, outside the periphery of Philosophy, loses its philosophical specification and gets explained/d efined in terms of literal and current usage that more or less becomes its identity. Deleuze, following Marcel Proust, attempts to explicate the term ‗virtuality‘ in hisDifference and Repetition , and says, ―We opposed the virtual and the real: although it could not have been more precise before now, this terminology must be corrected. The virtual is opposed not to the real but the actual. The virtual is fully real in so far as it is virtual . Exactly what Proust said of states of resonance must be said of th e virtual: ‗Real without being actual, ideal without being abstract‘‖ (1968:208). Here Deleuze‘s idea of the term is very explicitly put forth. He doesn‘t consider virtual as unreal, but he also doesn‘t recognize it as actual as the actual is the source for this virtual to be created.   If we focus our attention on the role of technology apart from virtual reality in deluding and disillusioning people from religion, we‘ll find that it plays an immense role
	. It was with the invention of the printing press tha t religious treatises, scriptures, and simultaneously religion became accessible to common men. After the printing press becamefunctional, the very first significant things published were religious materials. Similarly, if we talk about other scientific inventions that played crucial roles in making religion instilled more in the lives of people, we will find that these inventions, by making God and religion easily accessible to common men, created a big market.This market is simultaneously available for th e benefits of even those who are less religious, or, for that matter, consider themselves more rational, who moving beyond the blessings and curses 
	   263 of God uses the market to the fullest for their benefits. These technological advancements take physical pla ces (site) as raw materials for creating the new version of the same effecting desired changes to produce a more fascinating and enticing virtual world. In various games, many of the places of religious importance having been taken as a raw material of physical places are used, and the creator of Augmented Reality games having the freedom to usurp the sanctity, violates/may violate the norms leading to conflicts and tussles among people.   In VR, the viewer is given the power to navigate through which he can feel like he is walking through the streets. The VR headset bars the viewer from viewing anything else other than the thing being viewed. In the current technological world, two terms are in vogue for the simulation of reality, namely, Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR). Both were initially created for recreational purposes with the help of technology. Still, now they have headed towards the various other phases of human lives, particularly religion, which is being influenced by these in bo th the ways – positively and negatively. Augmented Reality is not the concern of this paper, but it would add to the clarity in understanding VR if it gets explained to be differentiated with similarities and contrasts. VR is entirely a simulation of real -life environments created with the help of a computer and imagination, sometimes excluding things from the real world.   In contrast, Augmented Reality uses the virtual as well as real images for the purpose. The fundamental difference identified is that VR is immersive; with it, the viewer gets immersed in the created environment and feels as if he is in the actual world. Augmented reality (AR) is not immersive like VR, it also is not viewed through any headset like VR headset, and instead it is used throug h mobile apps and computers/laptops for a similar purpose. It is primarily used for playing games. ‗Pokémon Go‘ is one of the top -rated augmented reality games. Augmented reality creates a totally artificial environment. In it, some juxtaposition is made o n the existing physical environment with information, graphics, sound, etc.   VR and AR, in a way, attempt to create a situation where the harsh reality of the physical world/environment is overcome and provides a world more than it exists. The world of vir tual reality is bound to be different from the world of harsh realities as its existence depends on its difference from its source. It can persuade the subject only through its more appealing truth -like imaginary figures. Talking about Mark Zuckerberg‘s vi sion of new technologies put forth at ‗F8 Annual Global Developer Conference‘ where he expressed his desire to create augmented reality to spice -up the everyday reality of our existing world, SundarSarukkai writes, ―It begins with dissatisfaction with the way the world appears before us. It panders to the worst of our human desires when it creates a world which is special to each one of us as if the world should be amenable to our desires rather than the other way around.‖ He continues saying, ―Like religio n, this new technology begins with a suspicion of the real physical world, always searching for something more than the world outside us. Both technology and religion do so by choosing the physical body as the fulcrum of all problems of the physical. They use selective ideas of liberation and freedom as an escape from the physical.‖ These technological products are gaining popularity more due to the approach of today‘s world, as we believe that escape is the easiest and the safest thing to accommodate us.   I feel, seeing virtual spaces in contrast to the truly real spaces may not be a correct approach in all cases. I agree with David J. Chalmers's views in this regard, which says, ―Virtual reality is a sort of genuine reality, virtual objects are real objec ts, and what goes on in virtual reality is truly real
	.‖ (2017:309). As some VR platforms, being true to their profession, do not tamper with the actual scenario of the religious spaces maintaining their sacredity, and provide the pilgrim undertaking this v irtual journey to the pilgrimage a real -life experience true to the physical one. In this regard, Hill -Smith observes,  ―Some cyberpilgrimages, such as the Second Life hajj  can be undertaken on real -life hajj dates to enhance the experience.‖ (2011:238). He  further adds,   
	   264 In Second Life‘s hajj, cyberpilgrims can ‗journey‘ together in pilgrimage garb via their avatars, an undertaking that can attract large numbers during real -life hajj. Using chat -windows, pilgrims can discuss personal experiences, motivation s, thoughts and problems, with other pilgrims, who form visible ‗presences‘ onscreen. Such interconnections, though lacking the depth of real-life face -to-face communication, can certainly help to foster a genuine sense of community, camaraderie, and commo n purpose, and imply a desire to build closer and more meaningful social interactions online, a point Lorne Dawson explores in ‗Religion and the Quest for Virtual Community‘ (2004, pp. 75 –89).‖ (Hill -Smith, 2011:239 -40).   Simulated Space and Religion: Ana lysis and Examples  These days, a shift in approach can very well be observed that religious places are also using these technological developments for their promotions and other purposes. Many of the holy places provide the opportunity to the whole world to havea virtual tou r of those sacred places. The website of the national Tamil daily ‗Dinamalar‘offers a 360degree view (a virtual tour) to most of the temples situated in Tamilnadulike Minakshi temple, Madurai; Parthsarthy Temple, Chennai; ViyakulaAnnai Church, Madurai; San thome Church, Chennai; Kazimar Big Mosque, Madurai; JummahPalliVasalPanikulam, Ayyappa temple Sabrimala etc. under the head ‗V -Darshana‘, which present exquisite instances of highly advanced architecture of South India, and are simultaneously promoting, sa tisfying, and invigorating at least partially the feeling of involvement with the religion. The official website of TamilnaduTourism offers a virtual tour to almost all the temples, churches, mosques, museums, and beautiful and enchanting places like Ootya nd Kodaikanal to attract tourists for actual visits. Likewise, Kerala Tourism and some other Indian states are making use of this technology for promoting tourism in the states.   Talking about the virtual church Rev. Dr. Christopher J. Benek, a techno -theologian,and Pastor at the First Presbyterian Church, Floridatold Hypergrid Business  Magazine, ―Numerous persons and groups have developed churches in the virtual world, mainly Second Life,‖ and ―I would venture to say that the most have been less concerned  with true evangelical success and more focused on what their technological exploratory experience may yield in the future.‖Dr. Benek goes to the extent of saying in his article titled, ‗Virtual Reality is the Future of Religion‘ published in h+Magazinetha t we won‘t even be able to imagine our existence without VR in next 25 years. He, talking about VR and Christianity, says — One of the largest beneficiaries of this technological development could be the global church because VR is going to change the way that Christians participate in worship. The main impact that VR is going to have on the global church is that it is going to, one -day, enable Christians to easily gather from a variety of places without being in the same physical location.  This will enable  persons who are homebound, sick, caregivers, without transportation, on vacation, or severely disabled to participate in worship with the larger community of faith without needing to leave the place where they are physically residing.   The move of virtua l reality in religion is very swift. In Indian religious spaces, Virtual reality is making its place at a breakneck pace, sensing an immense scope of business for the developers. A news article published in the Indian Express dated April 8, 2016, makes men tion of this new shift in the approach of Indian pilgrims who removing their ‗chappals or shoes‘ were entering the small temple -themed stall to experience the virtual as real replacing the actual. The news article depicts people of all ages wearing the VR headsets with the folded hands and reverent hearts overcoming their inability to visit the exact place of KumbhaMela and lord Mahakaal of Ujjain in Madhya Pradesh
	. Here, the center of attention for developing VR content was the visit of 75 million people t o the pilgrimage facing all sorts of difficulty. To enable people to avoid the journey, and to replace the actual with the virtual, the content developers worked on the project and spent substantial time in developing the content. They received tremendous response from people because physically visiting Ujjain during this Kumbha period is almost impossible for many, but their reverence for lord Mahakaal and Kumbha is 
	   265 unfathomable. So, utilising the most appropriate time with the thing in the highest demand,  i.e., Darshan and Mahakaal Bhasma Aarti though simulated, was quite satisfying for people who could not visit the place actually due to one or the other reasons. Religious tourism space has been identified as the potential place for work for VR and AR industry, which positively will affect India‘s approach to religion.   The virtual world created by technology affecting the religion will eventually change the culture, society, and ethnicity of a nation. This effect may be measured in both ways depending upo n the perception of the evaluator. This VR is a byproduct of simulation and simulacra both; here, some images, ideas, and environment don‘t have their originals in the existing world, and some are simulated from the actual world only. The terms, ‗Simulatio n, and simulacra‘ have been used here with their literal meanings to convey the ideas in a better manner.   The virtual world, in comparison to the actual one, is more persuasive as here we have scope to create, include, and exclude based on our choices, bu t in the world where we live, we have no choice but to live and face whatever comes before. Benson Rajan says, ―The religious institutions believe that the digital cannot make up for the physical, as they see digital interactions as a cold form of interact ion. It is unlike face -to-face interactions, which are seen as a more desirable means of attaining religious objectives as the individual is emotionally charged in physical encounters.‖ (2019:101 -102). However, this world of virtual reality is competent en ough to create a Utopian society, which is not possible in reality. A spectator can enjoy the freedom and pleasure of being in Utopia through it and can also feel the awe of being in a dystopian world. However, the feeling would be momentary yetit is possi ble.   CONCLUSION  It is apparent that technological advancements are directly interfering in the lives of people. Though they are virtually easing the journey of life yet actually depriving us of many things which we may not be noticing. Like God, technolo gy demands complete surrender to it for working efficiently as VR can serve the purpose when and only when you are not able to see anything other than what is being shown. But, simultaneously, speaking strictly about VR, it is going to serve for a better c ause to an extent by providing a chance of a virtual visit to those who are not able to visit certain religious places physically. Therefore, we can see and say that the future of this virtual reality is very bright; now, we have to see whether it brighten s and expands the feelings and attraction for religious places or darkens by confining them to the VR headsets and screens.   If attention be paid, it can easily be observed that virtual reality, being a product of actual and fictionalenvironment, affects t he real in the way the creator wishes. As happens in the case of Sociological criticism, society produces/affects the writer, and in turn, the writer and his writings affect/change the thinking and approach of society. This influence leading to a change in  society may be perceived as positive or negative, depending upon the perspective of the perceiver. This VR environment may also create a lot of positive changes in affirming the faith of religious creed by enabling them to overcome the physical obstacles in worshipping their gods in a more peaceful and harmonious (as per their comfort) environment. Enquiring about the difference between virtual and actual Darshan, some responded that in both the cases the God is seen through eyes, feeling a touch, in most of the cases is not allowed or possible due to the place being overcrowded.   Thus, the virtual darshan seems to be more fruitful from the monetary point of view too. But some, who have already visited the temple for quite some time and did the virtual darshan just for the sake of comparison, could explain the difference in a better manner
	. They believed that in the virtual darshan, some unexplored aspects make them interested in it and also in the actual darshan time for a devotee for being in the temple i s a significantconstraint, but here darshan is more thorough. The only difference that dominates is that the virtual darshan is not able to give the feeling that one finds being in the temple actually after facing a lot of hurdles for darshan. But it can b e concluded from the foregoing discussion that virtual reality platforms are facilitating darshan, worship, prayer, Aarti etc. to them who are not able to 
	   266 do all this physically due to some reasons and may produce in days to come more religious and cultura lly abided persons. The findings noted by Foltz in his article also go similar, ―The study found that most people using the Internet for religious purposes use it wisely, well aware of the limitations of electronic communities. It isthe media that islimite d, not the participants. Most participants realize the poor and hungry are not found in cyberspace, especially not in customized disembodied communities. Most warn against using the Internet as an escape from the real needsof real people. Most are aware th at we have more to say to one another than can be conveyed in binarystructured sentences.‖ (Foltz, 2003:329).   BIBLIOGRAPHY  Ameli, Saied Reza, (2009).

These principles provide strength to Indian democracy through modern media or fourth estate. The modern satellite and telecom munication have increased the speed of media activities, communication and dissemination of information. Hence, modern media has become more impact creating than ever earlier. The paradox here is to see how values and morals of Mahatma Gandhi are affecting  modern media and mediapersons in an age of speed and satellite communication. This age of media and modern technology was not there in the India at the time of Mahatma Gandhi. The paper aims to discuss the relevanceof Gandhian journalistic approach in mod ern media business in general and electronic media in particular.   Keywords: Electronic, Media, Mahatma Gandhi, Sting Operations, Investigation, Journalism, Values, Morals, Telecommunication, Dissemination, Knowledge Age   Introduction  ―Pen is mightier than sword‖ old proverb seems to be true even in today‘s context as the media appears to have gained more strength in the modern society through electronic information dissemination. In this context Chatterjee (2016) pointed out Communicat ion systems are shifting their modes from a mere means of getting information to a platform for marketing.Moreover, earlier forms of modern communication the telegraph, telephone and wireless were strictly under the control of the British government in Ind ia before 1947. Even under the independent Government of India, what the British government did with the media during the pre -independence days, continued. Radio was no exceptionmaybe due to this governmental control over media inDoordarshan, TV Networks a nd All India Radio, the concerned mediapersons were demanding more autonomy.   The relevant bill, in this context received assent of President of India on September 12, 1990 after being unanimously passed by the Parliament. It was finally implemented in Nov ember 1997. It was called the PrasarBharti Act. According to this Act, all the property, assets, debt, liabilities, payments of money dues, all legal proceedings involving Akashvani (All India Radio) and Doordarshan were transferred to PrasarBharti to mana ge their affairs independently. (Government of India, 1997)  Moreover, on International plane, guarantee of freedom of expression and information was recognized as a basic human right in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights adopted by the United Natio ns (UN) in 1948, the European Convention on Human Rights, the American Convention on Human Rights, and the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights. In particular, Article 19 of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights states: "Everyone has the r ight to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers‖.(United Nations Universal Declaration of Human  Rights, 1948). Gandhi has been fighting for all above mentioned rights and freedoms since the beginning of twentieth century   While discussingGandhian perspective on electronic media, quite a few questions and contexts arise here. First, what is the relev ance of Gandhian Perspective concerning modern electronic media? Despite Mahatma Gandhi‘s vast expanse of work in the field of print media journalism through his tabloids namely Indian Opinion, Young India and Harijan , Gandhi lived and functioned apparentl y in a different age and era
	. It was mainly the teleprinter, telegram, telephone and radio which could be regarded as expressions of electronic communication during Gandhi‘s time.  
	    269 For Gandhi, regularity, authenticity, selfless service, purposeful informati on dissemination for social upliftment and national independence were major principles and values underneath his journalism. Profiteering and aims of business were never the priority of journalism for Gandhi. Indeed, he practiced his ideals in journalism. He has, therefore, clearly laid down value orientation and moral bases of journalism extended to modern electronic means of media.(Gandhi, M.K., 1931).In this context Miike (2016) pointed out the importance of dialogue exchange. Therefore this paper aims t o discuss the relevance of Gandhian journalistic approach in modern media business in general and electronic media in particular.   Electronic Media after Gandhi  Electronic media comprises TV channels, blogging and social networking. The old style newspaper s and broadcasting has also become electronic in nature as they are equally available on Internet. In others words, almost all journalism, newspapers, telephoning have transformed into electronic media. Projectors, CD Players, Video Players, recorders have  all transformed into electronic media. Even Projectors, CD Players, Video Players recorders have all become part of old state technology. The electronic media works its ways in a few seconds only. Distance has little significance in affecting the efficien cy of electronic media. The consequences of electronic media communication and information are almost instantaneous. This is why this era of electronic media is also known as knowledge age.   This is an age much beyond the time of Mahatma Gandhi. He could n ot foresee such rapid changes today. Despite this limitation, Gandhian thought, idea and vision have a touch of timelessness in them because they are highly relevant for setting standard of fundamental policy making to show the path of balanced media opera tions and performance in this age of social networking .Entertainment, education and information dissemination  are three main formats of electronic media in the world today. These three formats are available in the form of movies, videos, slides, specialise d lectures and programmes, news exchanges on social networking sites and diversified applications available on mobile network etc. All these processes work through satellite communication. This is a complex network of electronic technology and knowledge dissemination. There are also value added features in electronic media available currently. Instruments of cameras and spy cameras and also hidden form of long distance satellite focussing and videography/ photography are also there.   All these formats and modes of electronic media have made quest for knowledge a very quick affair. Almost every topic of research and its related material becomes available for study in a jiffy with the push of a button. Thousands of books, encyclopaedia, research journals and topical articles from authentic genuine sources become instantly available for study purposes while sitting at one place. A researcher can do such studies and collect plethora of material from any corner of the world without going anywhere. Similarly, all news and entertainment from all over the world with great details are available to a researcher sitting at home.   Gandhian Views on Automation and Press Freedom  Descending of knowledge age from late Twentieth century onwards is a highly heartening feature of human life. It is generally understood that Mahatma Gandhi would never approve of such massive technology and automation not only in electronic media but also in modern human life style. Adhikari (2017) echoed the field of communication theory has been witnessing a paradigm shift thereby promoting multicultural and multidisciplinary theorization of communication.Yes, this is true but this truth is far from reality of Gandhian philosophy of life, politics, economics and journalism
	. Here it is well to see deeper aspects of the Gandhian way of life and the manner in which he used his journalism and communication techniques for the welfare and awareness of the common people of India.   It will be pertinent here to see Gandhi‘s ideas on mechanisation, automatio n, journalism and awareness of masses not only in India but also in the world. However, Gandhi did not oppose all machinery or machinery as such. He has stated this position very clearly and categorically. Thus, as early as 1926, he wrote:   
	    270 ―I am uncomprom isingly against all destructivemachinery .But simply tools and instruments and such machinery as saves individual labour and lightens the burden of the million of cottages, I should welcome. He has also stated that he was opposed only to such machinery whic h was meant to enrich the few at the expense of the many or to displace the useful labour of many‖.(Young India1926)   The electronic media technology and quick global reach was not there at the time of Mahatma Gandhi‘s life time. But one thing is clear. It  is that Mahatma Gandhi was not against the present form of erstwhile journalism transforming into electronic media. The above mentioned quotation of Mahatma Gandhi and his other writings also prove this. Various views that Gandhi has given in his writings  in My Experiments with Truth:An AutoBiography,Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi, Indian Opinion, Harijan, Young India,Nonviolence in Peace and War  and his Hind Swaraj or Indian Home Rule futher show his fundamental principles about journalism and journalis ts. These principles can be applied to the functioning of modern electronic media and media persons. In this regard a few quotations from the writings of Mahatma Gandhi are presented here:   ―Freedom of the press is a precious privilege that no country can forego‖.(Gandhi Mahatma, 1958)   ―The sole aim of journalism should be service‖ .(Young India, 1926)   ―The newspaper man has become a walking plague. He spreads the contagion of lies‖. (Gandhi,MK.,Rao, U.R,1963)   ―A Journalist‘speculiar function is to read the minds of the country and to give definite and fearless expression to that mind‖. (Gandhi, M.K., 1967)   ―Journalism should ever be prosecuted for selfish ends or for the sake of merely earning livelihood or worse still for amassing money‖. (Gandhi, M.K. ,1967)  There is also a well known UNESCO aphorism that says quite like quotation of MahatmaGandhi:   ―Since war begins in the minds of men, it is in the minds of men, defence of peace must be constructed‖. (UNESCO Preamble)   According to article 19(1)(a) all citizens, Press Council of India, Editors Guild of India and Supreme Court of India, and of constitution of India(COI) press and media shall have the right to speech and expression. These fundamental rights are also applicable to electronic media. Howe ver, this freedom is not absolute as the article 19(2) also speaks of power of the state to frame law for imposing reasonable restrictions so as to preserve decency, privacy of citizens and integrity and sovereignty of India. The Indian Constitution also p rovides for certain relevant corresponding duties for all those enjoying fundamental rights and other freedoms in the country (Part1V, Article 51a). These restrictions and freedoms are much more necessary for media in general and electronic media in partic ular. Security of the State , friendly relations with foreign states, public order, decency, morality and in relation to contempt of court ,defamation or incitement to an offence etc all require these restrictions and reasonable freedoms. Electronic media becomes a significant means to streamline such aspects and dynamics of national importance.(Orissa.gov.in/e -Magazine/orissarevier/Nov -2006/eng.Pdf/87 -96.Pdf.)   Gandhi anent Electronic Media  Miglani and Brar (2017) remarked media organizations are so busy m eeting their operational costs and safeguarding profitability, that well -being of employees has become a secondary concern. The cut throat competition has made performance inevitable while concerns like quality of work life of employees and their work plac e well -being has taken a back seat. But For Gandhi electronic media must serve as an instrument to bring about peaceful conflict resolution and development especially of the downtrodden and poor.During Mahatma Gandhi‘s time,in order to understand the aims and goals of journalism for Gandhi, media is considered as fourth estate in democratic setup alongwith
	 
	    271 legislature, executive and judiciary. It has been influencing every aspect of human beings life irrespective of place, religion, caste and creed. Its aim  to unfold underlying realities of life, media has to work in legally and socially permissible limits in contemporary times. Mahatma Gandhi‘s ideas continue to evoke interest not only in every human being but also on larger governmental, national and inter national levels even several decades after his death in 1948.   Gandhi always set high standards for printing words and was of the view that it was the only platform where you can address the mass society in one go and educate them for their multifarious ri ghts. In his Autobiography , he wrote that the sole aimof journalism should be service of Nation and people. The newspaper and media, according to him, has a great power, just as an unchained torrent of water submerges whole countryside and devastates crops  even so uncontrolled pen serves to destroy. If the control is from without, it proves more poisonous. It can be profitable only when experienced from within. Hence , highly responsible form of media coverage is necessary. (Gandhi, M.K., 1956).   His approach  to journalism was totally devoid of any self -interest. None of his contemporaries or others afterward used the media so forcefully to ponder over the general issues that concerned the society as he did. He knew the importance of communication and used it to shape the opinion and mobilisation of people. Gandhi was not only a journalist himself as editor of his three tabloid‘s namely IndianOpinion,Young India  and Harijan  but he also had good networking with the national and global community of journalists. Being the fourth pillar of democracy, it is its responsibility to work in the best possible way, to help the nation in adhering to the norms of effective welfare and development of society.(Battacharya, SN., 1998). In this context Chanda (2017) pressed the ne ed of media literacy. The electronic media has progressed from its preliminary stage to the one it has achieved now. From being an alien product , it went on becoming the means  adopted by the freedom fighters to realise the dream of a free India. It was the  press that went on hand in hand with Raja Ram Mohan Rai, RabindndraNath Tagore, Mahatma Gandhi and Subhash Chandra Bose to voice their call for independence. It was media that conveyed the message of the young revolutionaries to the Britishers. In the pre sent age of knowledge, the most powerful extension and expression of erstwhile traditional media is the electronic media.   Press/Media as Guiding Light  The might of the press can be understood from the fact that the Father of the Nation called the Press th e guiding light which he believed was an excellent means to unite country for strengthening the foundation of the movement against the British .In the contemporary India, Mahatma Gandhi was a great communicator. He adopted ‗Mass Line‘ approach to educate and mobilise millions of people for freedom struggle. In certain places and situations folk form of entertainment and communication facilitated the process of bringing home the concept of national freedom even to simple village folks. His salt Satyagraha was  an excellent example of communicating effectively with masses in an age when media was not having existing technology advancement. His methods of fast and vows of silence were also a means of communication with people and masses alongwith a source of self purification. In other words, he aimed to target with one stone, the two birds of communication and self -purification both, successfully and non -violently. Mahatma Gandhi reached millions of people across the world through his communication skills and journalistic approach. He put an ever -lasting impact on Indian national movement through waging a number of nonviolent battles almost single handily
	. It must be said that that despite being an idealist, Gandhi was not a utopian communicator. His apparently id ealism has mostly led to practical success in his experiments with truth, communication and journalism.   Gandhian Criticism of Electronic Media  He was critical of the tendency of journalists to pick up the bit from here and there and dish them for the pur pose of creating sensation. Gandhi regarded this as ‗back door journalism‘. (Gandhi, M.K., 1972).   Gandhi practised what he preached.  Gandhi‘s tabloids published no advertisement.  His approach to journalism was totally devoid of business and profit orient ed ambitions. However, with the invention of new 
	    272 technology in the field of communication such as TV, Internet, the concept of news reporting was not only limited to newspapers only. Initially there was only one channel, but then with the liberalisationpol icy, there came a wave of private channelswhich also brought incut throat competition . Media started to control the minds of people. It could make people believe what they wanted to state. With the rising competition, the standard of journalism and media started to fall. Media that was a mission before independence grew as a profession aft er independence and of late, it is being criticised for becoming a business without ethics  and without a genuine sense of social responsibility . Gandhi gives utmost priority to public interest for public advantage and benefit .(DuttaSoumya, 2011).   Gandhi w as highly critical of journalists and media persons who used their profession as a source of minting money  and building finances through advertisement in newspapers and TV channels. For him , journalists should not writeat the back of advertisement . Moreove r, the owners of print media and private channels are the owners of either a business establishment or an industrial house or a financial institute. Newsin the hands of these businessmen becomes a commodity. Thereby news which shall be a fair fact becomes― angled‖ or marketable news. It is widely known that Teleprinter, Telephone and Telegraph were a few electronic media for communication and information exchange in Gandhi‘s time. These were totally different from what we have today. There is great differenc e between electronic media during Gandhi‘s time and media today .Yet, there are the fundamental Gandhian principles for modern media to follow and observe practically.   Modern electronic media is also suffering from rampant corrupt practises  in the form of  planted stories, politically slanted coverage, working through personal loyalties, paid features and interviews and blackmailing through sting operations. Gandhi does not approve of such activities by media persons.  (Coronel, Sheilas, 1991)Thispaid electr onic media concomitant with resulting respective loyalty to different political parties and corporate houses necessitates a growing levelling of electronic media in relation to Gandhain ethics and moral values of broadcasting, telecasting and journalism. T he electronic media in Indian democracy is avowedly following the Gandhian values which were earlier applied to journalism. Yet, as evidences show especially different TVchannels for news and entertainment are committed with loyalty to one or another corpo rate house on one hand and different political parties on the other hand. Accordingly, they are following the interest, goals and values of concerned corporate houses, political parties and cultural organisations. For example in India, N18 Network safeguar ds the interest of MukeshAmbani,while Zee news and India TV are trying to be loyal to B.J.P. and RashtriyaSwavamSevakSangh(RSS). Such loyalties also lead to material benefits to media persons. As such, Rajat Sharma of India TV has been nominated as Preside nt of DDCA. None of the electronic media in Indian democracy is following Gandhian principles of impartiality, objectivity and non -profitability in their acts of dissemination of information. For example Doordarshan mainly protects and promotes the interes t of mainly ruling party, NDTV mostly criticises the BJP and NDA. while serving the interest of Indian National Congress and leftist parties. India Today on the other hand favours Indian National Congress.   Election Commission of India while expressing co ncern for paid news has implemented for the first time the ‗Voluntary Code of Ethics for Social Media‘ and found 1,297 such instances of paid news throughout the country by experts and nodal officials deployed in all constituencies for the purpose. The tre nd of presenting the advertising content in the guise of news and vice -versa has the potential of damaging the established norms thereby affecting not only the gullible audience but also the financial real estate, stock market, health and industrybesides undermining the democratic process
	. (Election Commission of India document 2019) Thus ethics have always remained a mainstay when reference to the traditional mass media in India is made. However, the recent technological and business developments have led to deviation from established norms especially under pressure from market forces. The influence is so evident that the explicit distinction between ‗News‘ and ‗Advertisement‘ is very difficult to make out.  
	    273  Gandhi does not approve of such activities by med ia persons. On the other hand the Gandhian perspective on media and journalism rests on following principles put in a nutshell:   a. Objectivity  b. Truth must prevail because truth has no fear c. Fearlessness  d. Social optimal information dissemination  e. Value orientation or ethical journalism  f. Against the concept of paid news  g. Journalists and mediapersons ipso facto  in electronic media also must not have the right to perform on the back of advertisement posters and electronic commercial  h. Media persons therefore  mu st be dedicated to thewelfare of the poor and for the nation  and also for the world  i. Media and journalism must run on no profit no loss basis  j. Come what may, regularityin journalism, newspapers and media programmes must be maintained. Resource crunch cannot  be a pretext to postpone the regular publication or filming of news stories and programmes   Purity of Means and Ends  Gandhi always believed that media should educate and inspire the masses for a greater cause. According to him, media should follow high et hical and moral standards by following value based journalism. However, the TRP based craze in rating has rendered media into a huge challenge to face for Indian democracy. Gandhianideas of purity of means and ends when applied to media set the narrative f or media. Media free from business vendetta can only enjoy the freedom as well as its ‗sanity‘. In order to have fair and objective reporting of electronic media, the Press Council of India, and Editors Guild of India, seemingly on Gandhian lines, have pre scribed norms of Code of Conduct for press and media in India:  a. Accuracy  b. Pre-publication verification  c. Caution against defamatory writings  d. Paramount National interest  e. Norms of investigating journalism  f. Fearlessness and social responsibility  g. Keeping away from  exaggeration, distortion and sensationalism  h. All creeds and communities must be shown equal respect. (Sachindananda, K.S.,2007)   Although, the Press Council of India and Editor Guild of India have laid down distinctive yardsticks of news writings, these ‗Canons of Journalism‘ have come under serious threat in recent times. Various news organisations and reporters forget the ‗Code of Ethics‘ in the acquisition as well as dissemination of information to the public. There can be various reasons for such non -objective reporting like sensationalism, increasing readership and viewship, pressure from proprietors, coercion from powerful and useful news sources and selective diffusion and retention of news items by journalists due to one or several reasons. For insta nce, ‗the principle of limitation of harm‘ is a rule set for the journalistic code of ethics which involves deletion of certain details from news reports like withholding the names of minor children, crime victims as well as certain informative details whi ch are irrelevant or crucial and its exposure might harm someone‘s reputation or create hurdles in the process of investigation. In theAarushi murder case of 2008 the media intensely scrutinisedthe case with its elaborate coverage. This forced the CBI to s eek the help of Supreme Court in order to curtail media from sensationalizing. Justice AltamasKabir stated,―We are asking the press not to sensationalise something which affects reputations‖. (ibnlive.com/news/aarushi -HemrajMurder)This case became sensatio nal on Internet and private television channels as well. As a result the masses attentiontowards the case widened and it became a topic of public interest in general. Thus, the need aroused to differentiate between ‗public interest‘ and ―interest of the pu blic‖. They both are relatively two different things as the first is concerned with the issues relating to the benefit of the public and the second is concerned with the issues which the public may find interesting
	. Thus, the issues which belong to the sec ond category should be taken care of judiciously so that they might not harm the privacy of the concerned or impair thereputation. It is therefore the primary responsibility of the mass media to be highly alert and vigilant   The Gandhian ‗ends and means‘ relates to another example of electronic media today 
	    274 ‗Sting Operation‘ is another secret weapon often used by press as well as television media. There is no denying to the fact that though sting operations have often exposed the truth by making startling r evelations which may be beneficial for the society but certain critics have put forth an interrogative mark on the ethical veracity of such operations by mediapersons. Though these sting operations bring the truth to forefront by exposing certain individua ls and such exposure may make the masses aware and alert but some other vices like falsehood, biased and prejudiced exposure are associated with sting operations which provide little opportunity to the victims to defend themselves in public. Certain questi ons on ethical propriety are associated with sting operations.These operations are indeed one sided affairs. In this way, they are a major scar on journalistic code of fairness and impartiality. For instance, ―Operation West End‖ organised by Tehelka and n umerous other instances their revelations created quite a stir regarding the ethical issues associated with such exposures, but failed to give way an alternative to investigative journalism.   Conclusion  Despite various pejorative aspects of modern electronic media, the strength of democracy is drawn to a large extent from journalism and electronic media and the extent of freedom of expression available to media persons. The more the exposure, the deeper a nd longer lastingis democracy. There is mutuality between democracy, journalism and electronic media. None can go alone. They are mutually interdependent. This is evertruer in this age of information and knowledge dissemination. It is truth that prevails f or Mahatma Gandhi. It means objective reporting and dissemination of news and knowledge.This necessity of objectivity is bound by freedom of expression within given ambit of social cohesion and ethics. Therefore, the Gandhian journalism and its basic princ iples observe rule of law and established social, political traditions and norms of propriety. Gandhian ethics are very clear on journalistic practices extendable to electronic media and media persons. Thus, without the observance of the basic principles or Gandhian perspective on electronic media, the purpose of democracy cannot be fulfilled.  Real power to citizens in a democracy can percolate down mainly through the Gandhian principles of journalism .Gandhi believed that it is sincerity, sympathy and char ity that touch the heart more than anything else. Gandhi as a developmental journalist showed an example to the present day media of how to practice ethics based on developmental journalism.   The basic principles of Gandhian journalism applied to modern el ectronic media are being challenged by corporatisation of media houses and globalised structures in the market placesIn this atmosphere paid news and propaganda have been realthreat for ethical journalism. For a few apparent exceptions like sting operation s etc., media in India is going quite in opposite direction of what Gandhi considers to be ethics of media and journalism. Most of the media and TV channels are owned by the corporate giants like MukeshAmbani and Subash Chandra and these giants are titled towards one or the other politicalparty or regime. Accordingly, news and other programmes clandestinely(become mouth pieces of ideology and acts of political party) pose a great threat to credibility and objectivity of electronic media The real question is  about the practical possibility of applying Gandhian ethics of journalism to modern media. Is it really possible? Will modern media be able tosustain itself if it really goes in the direction of Gandhian way?   REFERENCES  Bhattacharya, S.N. (1998).

Cinema as an effective form of media constructs an d reconstructs discourses on health communication. However, in terms of the quantum of work in this space, the output is meagre. This study uses social construction of reality as the theoretical basis and narrative analysis as the research method to examin e the cinematic representation of the Bhopal Gas tragedy, which left an extremely destructive impact on the city of Bhopal (India). It explores how cinema builds narratives around health communication and establishes how a real -world disaster was explored from different angles. The research paper positions the critical need to engage in deeper conversations on health ecosystems through films and locates how other dramatic elements overshadowed the serious engagement with the narrative of health communicatio n. Keywords - Health Communication, Bhopal Gas Tragedy, Environment, Cinematic Representation, Indian Cinema  Introduction  Communication is central to our everyday functioning and can be the very essence of the human condition (Berry, 2006) .Communication ―not only fulfils the social need but also fulfils various physiological and survival needs of society.‖ (Verma & Verma, 2017) Mass -mediated communication is one of the key  dimensions of the meta -narratives that explain the scholarly and practical expanse of communication. Multiple directional, disciplinary and domain -specific paradigms further create more focal points to understand the impact of mass -mediated communication on individuals, society, culture and processes related to them. Health Communication is one such domain that has strongly integrated itself to the mediated context both structurally and functionally. ―The objective of health communication is to disseminate  health information and knowledge among individuals as well as society by improving health literacy.‖ (Sharma, Nahak, & Kanojia, 2019) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) define Health Communication as ―the stud y and use of communication strategies to inform and influence individual and community decisions that enhance health‖ (Schiavo, 2011; Thomas, 2006).It is also one of the most vibrant, complex, and significant areas of research and practice in contemporary society. It influences persons throughout their lives, whether through interpersonal conversations about health, exposure to health images and information through the media, or involvement in the healthcare system. As health issues have become more pressin g in society, the interest in health communication and the roles for health communication scholars and practitioners are certain to increase (Harrington, 2014) .  With this increase in interest, health communication campaigns hav e been developed to address a wide variety of needs defined by policymakers, constituent groups, activists, and stakeholders, among others. Good communication is the key and is also pervasive in creating, gathering and sharing health information. It is a c entral human process that enables individuals and collective 
	     277 adaptation to health risks at many different levels (Berry, 2006) .  Exploring the interrelationship between Media and Health Communication  ―The media is an important  ally in any public health situation. It serves the role of being a source of correct information as well as an advocate for correct health behaviours‖  (Module 5: The Role of Media in Health Promotion, n. d.) . Mass media helps health workers to expand their reach and spread messages on health to all corners of the world. With the help of radio and television,overly critical information can be shared to the local audience, while making them aware. A study done in Swaziland shows us how radio broadcasts were used to train health professionals and the mothers of the ailing children about how to make the medicine for diarrhoea. It prevented the deaths of many infants. ―Given a similar level of staff effort but the far greater coverage achieved by radio, it was found that more than twice the number of mothers learned the correct procedure for mixing SSS (the medication) from the radio than did those who learned it from face -to-face communication‖ (n. d.) .  Mass media not only helps the message to reach the local audience but also plays an important role in gaining the attention of opinion makers, politicians, government regulators and community leaders. Mass media also recognized as a gatekeeper plays its role  in, ― alerting the public to what is important with a focus on accuracy and relevancy. This is done through media framing, by which mass media sets the tone through which the public will view the message.‖ (Villar & Marsh, 2020) For example, between 1982 and 1987, several members of the U.S. Congress placed AIDS on the political agenda by holding hearings on the growing numbers of people afflicted by it and research into its causes and prevention. Celebrity activists and spokesper sons covered by the media also increased the visibility of AIDS on the political agenda. However, it was not until 1987 that President Ronald Reagan gave his first public speech about AIDS. During that year,Congress also passed legislation that considered the larger societal implications of the epidemic and that went beyond funding for AIDS prevention, research, and treatment efforts. The AIDS Federal Policy Act of 1987 prevented discrimination against individuals with disabilities —including those with HIV/ AIDS (Century, 2003) .  With expansion and reach made possible by the Internet, people can now access health -related information on their devices, regardless of the location. Social media and its widespread users are the target a udience for many health campaigns. However, with access to resources, the concern is also towards the consumption of right and accurate information. ―For health communication programs, the Internet may become a countervailing factor and an obstacle as a source of misinformation and myth, particularly in the areas of infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS‖ (n. d.) .According to a study conducted on the implications of social media useon health communication in the United States, ―Recen t growth of social media is not uniformly distributed across age groups; therefore, health communication programs utilizing social media must first consider the age of the targeted population to help ensure that messages reach the intended audience. While racial/ethnic and health status -related disparities exist in Internet access, among those with Internet access, these characteristics do not affect social media use. This finding suggests that the new technologies, represented by social media, maybe changi ng the communication pattern throughout the United States‖ (Chou, Hunt, Hesse, Beckjord, & Moser, 2009) .  Contextualizing Health Communication Messages in Cinematic Texts and Contexts  Cinema is one of the most fundamental and effective forms of media, which presents as well as represents society and culture
	. In the process, it also constructs and reconstructs discourses on society and culture. Negotiation, appropriation and re -appropriation of ideologies are central to how cine ma creates these representations. The cinematic texts, i.e., films, draw from as well contribute back to the discourse of society and culture.Films, also as a medium, have been adopted by individuals, companies, and independent groups for the purposes of e ntertaining, informing and educating others in an entirely unique form (Nwokedi, 2018) .A study done by Yonsei University, Seoul, Republic of Korea, discusses how ―films can be more effective than text in 
	     278 eliciting consumer respo nses such as emotions and a positive attitude to an identified disabled personality as well as to the employer brand.‖ (Chang, 2020)   As a strong medium that weaves the discourse on important subjects, films have also been instrumental in mainstreaming the discussion on various taboos and stigmas related to health issues. Center for Disease Control (CDC) established the ‗Sentinel for Health Award for Daytime Drama‘ (CDC, 2002b) for dramas that inform, educate, and motivate viewers to make choices for healthier and safer lives. Similarly, the Sexual Health IN Entertainment Awards (SHINE) honour those who do an exemplary job of incorporating accurate and honest portrayals of sexuality into their television, film, and music vide o programming (The Media Project, 2002). The Entertainment Industries Council, Inc., in partnership with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the National Institute on Drug Abuse of the National Institutes of Health, sponsors the PRISM Awards which honou r the correct depiction of drug, alcohol, and tobacco use in television and feature films, music, and comic books.   In the words of Dana March, Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, ―Television and film are powerful tools to disseminate heal th information, promote health, and construct health -related narratives‖ (Communicating to Advance the Public's Health: Workshop Summary, 2015) . Indian cinema has addressedhealth issues in its storylines for long.However, in te rms of the quantum of work in this space, the output is meagre. While numbers do not present a very favourable relationship between films and issues related to health; there has been a paradigm shift in the representations. Protagonists in contemporary, co mmercial Indian cinema now play characters with health problems. The discussion on the health issue and a consequent message, therefore, has amplified significant conversations about the potential of films to influence effective health communication.   The first Indian film which can be discussed in this category is Dushman  (1939). Dushman  (Hindi for ‗enemy‘), is a love story where Tuberculosis is portrayed as the enemy. This film clearly carried a social message of spreading awareness about the disease. (Kumbhar, 2019) . Doctor  (1941) was another film which discussed cholera, infant and maternal death, p oor public hygiene and absent public healthcare infrastructure. (Kumbhar, 2019) . Few recent films that have focused on subjects related to health are -Black  (2005)by. Sanjay Leela Bhansali, which dwelled on a rarely discussed health condition of ‗Alzheimer‘s‘ in geriatric patients; TaareZameen Par  (2007) produced and directed by  Aamir Khan which discussed dyslexia and effectively campaigned for holistically empowering patients, caregivers, parents, teachers and the society at larg e. Another recent film, Udta Punjab (2016), systematically handled a controversial subject of drug abuse in Punjab‘s youth and gave direct 
	     279 economic and political set up in which a person is living‖ (Mahmood, 2013) . Films also create debate, they create conversation, they create an atmosphere… made by film -makers who want to take a positi on on a topic‖ (Shah, 2011) .  With the advancements in digital technology and the plethora of information available, films related to health disasterstake on gigantic proportions (Treloar, 2005) . How ever, as films address real -world catastrophes by inserting cinematic elements of genre, technique and aesthetics, they do not only shed light on a situation and its ramifications; but also humanize sensitive subjects thus creating more a more humanized di scourse on even issues related to health. There are many films which represent disasters caused by human error which lead to health hazards. Some aspects of such films ―do not mirror the reality of disasters. By terrifying and establishing blame, disaster films create a sense of moral order. This supports the belief that disasters are avoidable rather than an expectable outcome of the failure of complex systems over which human control is very imperfect‖ (Ursano, McCaughey, & Ful, 199 5). Films intervene by building narratives and content around hazardous disasters created by human error, thus creating awareness as well as offering critical reflection.   The Bhopal Gas Tragedy – A Factual Overview  This study discusses the cinematic  representation ofthe Bhopal Gas tragedy. The Bhopal gas tragedy is one of the biggest industrial disasters which left an extremely destructive impact on the city of Bhopal (India) and its citizens. The disastrous event has marked its thirty -five years in December 2019, and even now people are suffering from the adverse effects of the poisonous gas which resulted in the death of innumerable people living in Bhopal on the night of 2 -3rd December 1984. The massive tragedy and disaster shook the entire country  and lead to a huge health hazard.   ―A government affidavit in 2006 stated that the leak caused 558,125 injuries, including 38,478 temporary partial injuries and approximately 3,900 severely and permanently disabling injuries‖  (Dube y, 2010) . ―Others estimate that 8,000 died within two weeks, and another 8,000 or more have since died from gas-related diseases‖  (Eckerman, 2004) . The cause of the disaster remains under debate. The Indian government and l ocal activists argue that slack management and deferred maintenance created a situation where routine pipe maintenance caused a backflow of water into a MIC tank, triggering the disaster.  The Union Carbide Corporation  (UCC) argues water entered the tank th rough an act of sabotage. About 500,000 more people suffered from agonizing injuries with disastrous effects of the massive poisoning. The hospitals were full of the dying victims and doctors did not know how to treat them because they did not know which g as or gases had leaked, and Union Carbide would not release the information, claiming it was a ―trade secret‖ (Swamy, 2014) .  After the night of the incident, the factory was locked up. Thousands of tons of pesticides and waste remained inside and was never cleaned. The chemicals were abandoned in warehouses exposed to wind and rain. Thirty -four monsoons have rusted and rotted the factory and washed the poison deep into the soil. The poison has entered the groundwater and seeped into wells and bore pipes, gushed from taps and entered people‘s bodies and burned stomachs, corroded skin, damaged organs and flowed into wombs.   According to a January 2013 report of the Indian Institute of Toxicology Research, Lucknow, the soil and groundwater within 3.5 kilometres from the UCC factory site is contaminated with cancer - and birth defect -causing chemicals. From 1969 to 1977, the Union Carbide used to dump its toxic wastes at 21 spots, most of them unlined pits, inside the 68 -acre facto ry premises
	. Despite 17 agencies, including government and non -governmental organizations, carrying out studies over the past two decades, a comprehensive plan for remediation of the soil and groundwater has not been prepared (The Hindu, 2014) .  The death of Warren Anderson, Chairman  and CEO of the  Union Carbide Corporation , five years back had marked anuproar in the city due to the anger for the judicial system which failed to deliver justice for millions of peo ple who lost their family and are still suffering from the harmful and 
	     280 poisonous gas leak effects. Survivors are unhappy with the court proceedings and compensation. The primary reasons for such disasters: ―The indifferent attitude of the management toward s safety, the lax enforcement of the existing regulations by the regulatory bodies as well as unusual delays in the judicial systems.‖ (J.P.Gupta, 2002)  Out of 25000 casualties, the government has paid compensation for only 5,2 95. Rashida Bee, President of Bhopal Gas PeeditMahila Stationery Karmachari Sangh complains,―three generations of gas leak victims have suffered from their children being born with disabilities but little was done by the government to help victims and to g ive medical assistance to their families‖ (The Hindu, 2014) .  Films act as mirrors of our society and health communication is now one of the major themes of film narratives in India and the rest of the world. ―Among public healt h researchers, there is growing interest in film methods due to their ability to highlight subtleties in practices, capture emotions, engage hard -to-reach populations, and advocate for social change.‖ (Baumann, Merante, Folb, & Burke , 2020)  They help in bringing out all different facets of the health issue and communicate with the audience at a deeper level. In a study where films were used as drug -resistant strategies, the results show that ―films were effective in decreasing se lf-reported use of drugs other than alcohol over 1 month.‖ (Hecht, Corman, & Miller, 2009)  Even so, it can be said that the effectiveness is not same with all health issues and this study will further focus on the other stronge r aspects of the society which play their role in defining the wide reach and acceptance of this medium.   Needfor the Study and Research Objective/Questions:  Considering the impact of Indian media and Indian cinema onour society, the representation of health communication in the countrypoints us towards the gap which gets established from the review of literature, focusing on the lack of efficient and competent representation of real -life health disaster. This study aims to examine the representation of  the Bhopal Gas Tragedy in the cinematic medium.This study instigates the social construction of Health Communication and attempts to answer the following question: To what extent does the cinematic medium helps to develop an effective narrative on health communication through the cinematic representation of health hazards?   Data and Sample  The study examines two of the only films made on the disastrous event of Bhopal Gas Tragedy in India:  1. Bhopal Express -a 1999 Hindi  film directed by Mahesh Mathai  2. Bhopal – a Prayer for Rain -a 2013 film directed by Ravi Kumar   A tragedy of this magnitude which caused a massive health hazard has not been adequately addressed in mainstream Indian cinema. There are many humanized narratives of the event with survivors‘ testim onies, but only two films till date have addressed this issue. It is said that films ―depicting disasters and catastrophes have been much talked about, but little -studied‖ (Quarantelli, 2009) . While talking about films depicting catastrophes, Gershenson questions, ―Why we don‘t know these films? Of course, they exist - on archival shelves, on illegal websites, and in the memory of those who saw them years ago. And yet they don‘t exist - they hav e no physical presence, either as widely distributed DVD‘s or web -streams today, or at festivals and movie theatres at the time of their release‖ (Gershenson, 2013) .This study looks for answers to the same question.   Theoretical and Epistemological Underpinnings  This work is based in the interpretative paradigm. Understanding the power of the media in the social construction of reality is important, particularly when we have such a wealth of evidence describing how films, televisi on and other media sources continue to somewhat rigidly define roles and expectations for less powerful groups in society (Eschholz, Bufkin, & Long, 2002) 
	. Peter Berger and Thomas Luckmann, in their publication, The Social Const ruction of Reality , coined the notion of ―social construction‖. They used this term to refer to what they consider as the process of actively constructing one‘s social world rather than having such meaning imposed. It relates to the meaning that humans giv e to their world from a social context (Beeton, 2006) . Quoting Berger and Luckmann (1967), Adoni and Mane (1984, 
	     281 p.325) discuss the concept of sociology of knowledge. They state that everything in society, and not just intellect ual articulations, constructs social knowledge and therefore media play a significant role in the social construction of knowledge. To explain the concept of media and social construction of reality, the authors discuss three kinds of social reality – objective, symbolic and subjective. Objective reality refers to information accessed by people and even though they can doubt it, they suspend these doubts to be able to think routine thoughts and perform routine actions (p.Adoni& Mane, pp. 325 -326). Media con tent, art, literature among other things constitute symbolic reality (p.326). The objective and symbolic reality fuse to provide inputs to individuals to form theirnotions of subjective reality, which may further be based on two factors – ‗zones of relevan ce‘ and ‗here & now‘ (p.326). Media content is constructed based on objective and symbolic reality while its consumption constructs subjective reality for the audience. Hence,the media‘s role in the social construction of reality is inherent and critical. This perspective can help for the systematic examination of the contribution of the media to the social construction of reality.  This research paper focuses on an issue which has proximity to Indian cinema, with the zone of the relevance of the present sit uation where children are born deformed even today in the affected areas of Bhopal.   The reality gets constructed through a medium like cinema, with its narrative and perspective around the event. The impact of this reality on people is disastrous. For generations diseases caused due to the gas leak, have been passed on in families. It is very unfortunate even after thirty -five years, people have not received compensation from the government organizations.In his book The Cinema of the Precariat: The Exploi ted, Underemployed, and Temp Workers of the World , Thomas Zaneillo discusses how the story of a precariat is lost under the heavy and big names of the industrialist. The ironic use of the term ―accident‖ during such industrial hazardous reflects the entire  event to be ―unexpected, genuinely surprising, the unknown quantity in a discovered planetary habitat… The death and injury toll of the precariat and other workers in the surrounding neighbourhoods in all these ―accidents‖ is always staggering.‖ (Zaniello, 2020) Hence, it is critical to reflect on the fact a disaster of such extreme magnitude has hardly received any cinematic attention. In terms of popular cinema, the attention given to this subjecthas not achieved any success a s the audience isnot even aware of the existence of these films because of poor production values and no commercial success.Another significant critique that emerges is the absence of any attempt to create consistent discourse around the disaster. The narr ative is lost and so is the reality that these two films tried to create around the subject.   Exploring the Representation of Bhopal Gas Tragedy - Narrative Analysis of Bhopal Express and Bhopal – a Prayer for Rain  The study of cinematic storytelling focuses on the story structure and how the film affects our perception, cognition, and emotions. Narrative analysis is hence the effective methodology to be used. Narrative analysis (Gee, 1991; Kirkman, 1997; Riessman, 1993,&2001) focuses on the way indivi duals present their accounts of themselves and views self -narrations both as to constructions and claims of identity (Burck, 2005) . Narrative analysis is a strategy that recognizes the extent to which the stories we tell provide  insights about our lived experiences (Sandelowski, 1994) . Also, narrative methods can be considered ―real world measures‖ that are appropriate when ―real -life problems‖ are investigated.   By applying narrative analysis on two  films – Bhopal Express (1999)  and Bhopal – a Prayer for Rain (2013) ,one can endeavour to understand the portrayal of the same issue from different perspectives
	. Also, narrative analysis helps us to interpret and conclude by focusing on different elements.  These elements include, but are not limited to, how the story is structured, what functions the story serves, what is the substance of the story, and how the story is performed.   Discussion  Bhopal Express  - 1999 film directed by Mahesh Mathai  Bhopal Express narrates the entire incident from the eyes of a newlywedcouple, Verma and Tara. The very first scene shows a man running on the railway tracks trying to stop the trains to enter the city. Later, we get to 
	     282 know the reason why he is trying to do so. With the progress of the plot, we understand that Tara is observing  KarvaChauth which is undertaken by Hindu women for their husband's good health. Hindu tradition also dictates that the wife should spend some time with her mother during certain months of th e year to avoid giving birth to a child at inauspicious times; hence she leaves for her mother's home. (Nadar, n.d.)  That very night there is a leak in the factory which leads to a major disaster.   The use of music is highly effective as it invokes the sensation of the tragedy and supports the visuals. The visuals are very emotionally arousing as people drop dead like flies. The amount of loss of life and the rise of the death toll by the next morning leaves you in shock.   Bhopal: a prayer for rain - 2013 film directed by Ravi Kumar  In Bhopal: a prayer for rain , the plot revolves around the same incident. Dilip (Rajpal Yadav), a rickshaw driver, loses his pay source and gets a job in the plant as a labourer, and is happy since h is daily wage is restored. The plant witnesses a drop in its revenue due to lower sales of pesticides, and to reduce the loss the officials neglect safety and maintenance. Questioning the chemicals used in the plant, Motwani (Kal Penn) a tabloid reporter p ublishes reports in his makeshift printing press which are disregarded by most of the officials and workers. Roy, the in -charge for the safety of the plant expresses his concerns. The officials, however, ignore his warnings, and a worker is killed when  methyl isocyanate leaking from a pipeline drips off on his hand. The officials deem the worker's irresponsibility as the cause of the accident and the plant continues to function. Dilip is given a better -paying vacant job in the plant despite lacking the skil l to operate machinery. A gas leak is prevented by Roy when water is mixed with methyl isocyanate, and to stop people from panicking, the official in the plant sabotages the warning siren.   Warren Anderson, the CEO of the Union Carbide, visits the plant to inspect its functionality, where he is briefed about a plan to connect two additional tanks for storage of methyl isocyanate to increase the output of the plant, ignoring the deteriorated c ondition of the tanks.To overcome the increasing revenue loss, the officials shut down the plant, firing most of the workers, including Dilip.  One night the safety measures fail, and a runaway reaction follows. The faulty tanks cause the gas to start leak ing. The gas is exposed to the surroundings and is carried east by the wind. Motwani rushes to alert the people in the vicinity of the plant to vacate and head west since the warning sirens were previously sabotaged. As the gas shows its effects, a nearby hospital is filled with hundreds of patients reporting cyanide poisoning, and the lack of antidote results in most of the patients' death. Dilip, in the last of his energy, throws away his Union Carbide identity badge, rests his son on the ground and succu mbs to the toxic gas. The story jumps to the present day, where a blind boy is holding Dilip's identity badge, and the film ends with Dilip narrating the words "Whatever may be the cause of the disaster, Carbide never left Bhopal. A photo montage depicts t he aftermath of the disaster (Kumar, 2014)   Both the films depict the tragedy and sensitize the viewers about this human -made tragedy three decades ago which lead to the death of over ten thousand people. They also portray the h uge insensitivity on the part the political fraternity and the corporate breed that led to the entire tragedy. Bhopal Express  focuses on the event and the day after, whereas Bhopal -A prayer for rain  discusses various other issues like the ethical dimension  of the political and industrial sectors. It also shows the warnings which the Union Carbide was given about the safety measures that were not undertaken and hence led to the disaster
	.   Conclusion and Recommendations  The narrative analysis of both films establishes that a real -world disaster was explored from different angles. While the health hazard discourse was central to the storylines, other more dramatic elements overshadowed the attention and engagement with the  narrative of health communication.   However, a critical insight that emerges from the study is that health communication is understood in an interpretative ecosystem which includes several social, political, cultural, ideological and even economic codes.  Hence, when films focus on health disasters, 
	     283 they cannot represent monolithic narratives which will only create awareness about a health problem. This study demonstrates that a more nuanced and complex investigation of cinematic representations of health communication should be taken up as a long -term study.   It will only then be possible to make recommendations that can impact not just the responsibility of cinema to address societal issues, but also influence policymakers in certain ways. An audience im pact study as the next step can shape a holistic understanding of this subject.

We propose, and assess, a model of reported investment behaviour andinvestment behaviour intention. We find a larger association between FoMO and crypto ownership,both current and intended, compared with stocks. FoMO has a small association with current stockownership, relative to the association of financial literacy and risk tolerance. Context matters whenmeasuring FoMO with the more context-specific measures having the largest associations withinvestment behaviour and investment intentions.

IntroductionThe fear of missing out (FoMO) has become a widely referenced motivator of cryptocur-rency (henceforth crypto) investment. For example, a 2022 New York Times Money feature“Everyone Has Crypto FoMO ”highlights the apparently widespread prevalence of FoMO1,while the same year ’s NFL Superbowl featured several crypto exchange advertisementswith “Don ’t Miss Out ”themes.2While this suggests a common understanding of FoMO, con-sensus is lacking in its conceptualisation and measurement in an investment setting. It isunclear whether FoMO extends to other assets, notably stocks, and how FoMO relates toestablished predictors of consumers ’investment choices, primarily financial literacy, andrisk tolerance. This is the focus of our paper. We propose and evaluate a simple model ofcrypto and stock investment to investigate the direct effect of FoMO on investment,© The Author(s), 2023.

	whether financial literacy is an antecedent of FoMO, and whether FoMO has an indirectinfluence on investment via risk tolerance.FoMO has been defined as the “pervasive apprehension that others might be havingrewarding experiences from which one is absent ”(Przybylski et al. 2013 : 1841). FoMOwas first proposed to explain the purchase of limited-edition sneaker brands (Herman2000 ) but has predominantly been used to explain (problematic) social media andmobile-phone use (Buglass et al. 2017 ; Wang et al. 2019 ). While most conceptualisationspropose FoMO as the motivator of behaviour, Buglass et al. ( 2017 ) suggest the behaviour(e.g., social network use) leads to FoMO, while Lo Coco et al. ( 2020 ) proposes a bi-directional relationship. FoMO has been associated with other behaviours such as TV view-ing (Conlin et al. 2016 , Maxwell et al. 2022 ), broadened to a consumer-centric versionlinked to missing consumption experiences (Good and Hyman 2021 ), and associated withtypes of consumption (e.g., conformity and conspicuous consumption, Argan et al. 2022 ).Relative to the already large FoMO literature, as evidenced by three recent meta-analyses(Akbari et al. 2021 ; Fioravanti et al. 2021 ; Zhang et al. 2021 ), research on FoMO in an invest-ment context is small. Available literature suggests higher FoMO among crypto and stockowners versus non-investors (Kim et al. 2020 ), a mediating role for FoMO on “dark Tetrad ”personality traits for crypto attitudes and crypto intentions (Martin et al. 2022 ), and apositive role of FoMO in initial coin offerings (ICOs) (Karkkainen 2022 ). Few papers con-sider the role of FoMO in stock investing though some consider the role of FoMO in aspectsof stock investment or investing generally (Argan et al. 2022 ; Gupta and Shrivastava 2021 ;Narula et al. 2020 ).Our interest in the role that an individual ’sown fear of missing out plays in financialasset ownership complements a large empirical literature that has sought to explain whyothers miss out on participating in risky asset markets. In the case of stocks, non-participation “is likely to be a mistake ”(Campbell 2016 ; 10), which implies the role ofknowledge in investing. Similarly, FoMO implies knowledge of expected investment ben-efits that may be missed or at least an awareness of the investment option. Either is con-sistent with the view that perception of missing out is a necessary part of FoMO (Gupta andSharma 2021 ). Financial literacy is a positive predictor of stock market participation(Lusardi and Mitchell 2014 ; van Rooij et al. 2011 b; Yoong 2011 ) and stock portfolio diver-sification (Abreu and Mendes 2010 ; Giofré 2017 ; Guiso and Jappelli 2009 ; Koh et al. 2020 )which suggests that in addition to a direct effect of financial literacy (knowledge) oninvestment, financial literacy may work indirectly through FoMO to impact investmentdecisions.For crypto, there is less consensus as to the role of financial literacy with the attentiongiven to crypto described as a “mania ”(Smales 2019 ) with patterns of prices driven byindividual investors suggesting a speculative bubble (Cheah and Fry 2015 ), not discouragedby early advice from some central banks to avoid participation in crypto assets (Hackethalet al. 2021 ). This suggests FoMO may directly predict crypto ownership, independent offinancial literacy. However, other crypto characteristics suggest a positive financial liter-acy role, given diversification benefits (Bouri et al. 2020 ; Chopra and Mehta 2022 ).3Forexample, Bitcoin ’s“unique risk-return characteristics follows a different volatility processwhen compared with other assets and is uncorrelated with other assets ”(Baur et al. 2018 :109). Understanding this role requires a higher level of financial literacy, though it is notobvious diversification benefits are a FoMO driver.Modern portfolio theory (MPT) includes emotions, given it “implicitly assumes thathuman beings dislike high variance, as high variance tends to increase feelings of anxietyor fear ”(Uberti et al
	. 2013 : 5). More generally “non-portfolio factors ”can be accommo-dated in MPT as “the expected utility maxim provides a framework of analysis ”3Though reduced through the COVID-19 pandemic (Allen 2022 ).104 Paul Gerrans et al.https://doi.org/10.1017/flw.2023.6  Published online by Cambridge University Press
	(Markowitz 1959 : 210), and “fear or some other risk aversion relevant emotions can bethought as a state-contingent increase in the curvature of the utility function ”(Guiso2015 : 294). Other models present a means of including emotions more directly such asUberti et al.'s (2013) generalized mean-variance theory or the broader two-factorSecurity-Potential/Aspiration model (Lopes 1987 ; Lopes and Oden 1999 ), which combinesdispositional and situational factors to explain risky choices. We expect both risk tolerance(dispositional preference between Security and Potential) and FoMO (which may act to setan Aspiration level (A)) to explain investment choice. This allows separating how an indi-vidual “usually looks at risks ”from how an individual “reflects the opportunities at hand ”(Lopes 1987 , 19), including new assets like crypto.FoMO has predominantly been studied as a personality trait (Maxwell et al. 2022 ).Przybylski et al. ( 2013 ) identify FoMO as a latent trait, situationally activated when indi-viduals ’basic needs are not met (Zhang et al. 2020 ). Others broaden the construct anddistinguish state-FoMO, a specific cognition within the online context, from trait or dis-positional-FoMO, reflecting a relatively stable individual characteristic (Wegmann et al.2017 ). Zhang et al. ( 2020 ) propose FoMO as an emotional response to perceived threatsto the self-concept4, private (personal) and public (social) and define FoMO as “a fearof missing an experience that can help an individual maintain or enhance their pri-vate/public self ”(Zhang et al. 2020 : 1622). A personal dimension is expected to be morerelevant to the investment context, where investing is expected to be linked to the indi-vidual benefits the investment provides. Our approach is consistent with treating FoMO asa trait, capturing individuals ’disposition to the emotional response of anxiety and appre-hension from the perception of missing out on investment benefits. We use a psychomet-rically validated FoMO scale (Zhang et al. 2020 ) but, consistent with the approach ofDohmen et al. ( 2011 ) when examining risk attitudes, we also explore whether there is“value-added from asking context-specific questions ”(Dohmen et al. 2011 : 525) by explor-ing FoMO for specific investments. We are also interested in the role FoMO plays inexplaining gender differences in investment, in a similar vein to Jacobsen et al. ’s(2014 )examination of optimism. To investigate these relationships, we utilise a sample of under-graduate students drawn from a large Australian university. While student samples reducethe ability to generalise results, in the case of crypto young adults are a key demographic.For example, while the average age of Australian investors is 46 years (ASX 2020 ), esti-mates for the proportion of those aged 18 –34 years owning crypto range from 47 percent(Finder 2022 ) to 58 percent (ASIC 2022), comparable to the US where 43 percent of 18 –29year-olds have invested in crypto (Perrin 2021 ). Further, the incidence and effects of FoMOare higher among younger adults (Australian Psychological Society 2015 ), making the cur-rent 18 –25-year-old sample of interest.Our contribution is fourfold. First, we provide a comparison of context-free and invest-ment context-specific FoMO scales on the reported current and intended ownership ofstock and crypto. While it is argued “theoretically, individuals may fear missing out onanytype of consumption experience ”[emphasis added] (Zhang et al. 2020 , 1631), in thecase of stock or crypto investment, the association between these dimensions and the pro-pensity to invest has not been investigated. Our second contribution is estimating thedirect and indirect effects of FoMO, and financial literacy as an antecedent to FoMO.This complements emerging literature documenting the demographic characteristics ofcrypto investors (e.g., Hackethal et al. 2021 ). Third, we assess whether FoMO can explaingender differences in stock and crypto ownership, and whether there are gender differ-ences in the sensitivity to FoMO
	. In addition, our paper can contribute to the emergingpolicy discussion of the appropriate regulatory oversight of cryptocurrencies and crypto4Defined as “the totality of the individual ’s thoughts and feelings with reference to [the] self as an object ”(Rosenberg 1989 , 34). See Rosenberg ( 1989 ) for a review.Journal of Financial Literacy and Wellbeing 105https://doi.org/10.1017/flw.2023.6  Published online by Cambridge University Press
	assets for retail investors. For example, the Australian government has commenced a“token stocktake ”as part of its consultation on “a framework for industry and regulators,which allows consumers to participate in the market while also better protecting them ”(Chalmers 2023 ).To preview our results, we find FoMO has a significant association (medium effect size5)with current crypto investment and future stock or crypto investment intentions.Financial literacy and risk tolerance have larger associations than FoMO with current stockownership, whereas for current crypto ownership, FoMO has a larger association. Financialliteracy retains a significant small effect for future stock investment but is not economi-cally meaningful for crypto. We add to our understanding of the role of financial literacy,finding it to be an antecedent of FoMO, more so for stocks. While our evidence supports arole of FoMO on investment via risk tolerance, it is a small effect. FoMO does not appear toexplain more than a small amount of previously documented gender differences in finan-cial asset ownership in our sample. Finally, in terms of measurement, context appears tomatter when measuring FoMO with more context-specific measures (i.e., stock, or crypto)having the largest associations.The next section briefly reviews the literature that has examined emotions in assetpricing and reviews evidence on the strong gendered differences in the level of participa-tion in financial asset markets. The latter highlights the characterisation of non-participation (missing-out) on risky assets as a mistake. This section also reviews the roleof financial literacy and risk tolerance as well as evidence on the correlations of FoMOincluding the role of personality. Section 3 reviews the data and method and the followingsection presents the analysis. The final section provides a summation and suggestions forfuture research.2. Literature“Missing-out ”or“non-participation ”in stock markets is one of several “unambiguous mis-takes ”(Campbell 2016 : 10) consumers make where costs of non-participation are stagger-ing (Bucher-Koenen et al. 2021 ). Stock participation varies markedly across countries. Forexample, the U.S. direct participation rate is less than half of that in Australia (15 vs 34percent), though more than a quarter larger than in Germany (15 vs 11 percent) (Badarinzaet al. 2016 ). Early estimates (2018) suggested smaller differences in crypto ownership ratesacross countries relative to stock with crypto ownership in the US (8 percent), Europe(nine percent), and 7 percent in Australia (ING 2018 ). However, crypto ownership ratesare increasing rapidly, reflecting a global phenomenon (Feyen et al. 2022 ), doubling acrossa range of countries between 2020 and 2022. For example, in Australia (from 8 to 18 per-cent), Singapore (10 to 25 percent), and Thailand (18 to 44 percent) (Statista 2022 ).62.1. FoMO, emotions, and personalityExamining FoMO ’s role adds to a literature that considers emotions and traits in invest-ment and asset pricing. Aside from a direct effect of FoMO on investing, a possible indirecteffect of FoMO is via risk tolerance, given “emotions determine tolerance for risk ”(Shefrin2002 : 121). A distinction can be made between incidental and integral emotions (Hasan et al.2021 : Zaleskiewicz and Traczyk 2020 ). For example, incidental emotions relating toweather (e.g., Hirshleifer and Shumway 2003 ; Kamstra et al. 2003 , Kramer and Weber5To facilitate communicating the practical significance of results, throughout the paper, we follow Cohen(1988 ) to classify the magnitude of estimated effects as: small (standardized effect 0.2), medium (0.5), and large(0.8).6Feyen et al. ( 2022 ) suggest caution with data accuracy.106 Paul Gerrans et al.https://doi.org/10.1017/flw.2023.6  Published online by Cambridge University Press
	2012 ), mood (e.g., Hirshleifer et al. 2020 ), and sentiment (Baker and Wurgler 2006 ) arefound to be linked to asset returns. FoMO can be grouped with integral emotions suchas fear (Durand et al. 2011 ; Drechsler 2013 ) and excitement and anxiety (Andrade et al.2015 ; Hasan et al. 2021 ).Claims that standard financial theories cannot explain return and price patterns ofearly cryptocurrencies (i.e., Bitcoin, Kristoufek 2013 ) led to an interest in psychologicalmechanisms underpinning crypto trading and trader risks (Oksanen et al. 2022 ), and per-sonality differences among stock, crypto, and non-investors (Kim et al. 2020 ).Experimental evidence suggests “the marginal price of securities is set by investors whosepersonalities ‘attract ’them to traits in those securities. ”(Durand et al. 2013 : 125). Recentmeta-analyses (Highhouse et al. 2022 ) provide evidence of significant correlation betweenrisk propensity and Big-5 personality traits7, similar to results using self-reported invest-ment behaviours (Pinjisakikool 2018 ) and in trading behaviour in an experimental setting(Oehler et al. 2018 ).Similar associations between FoMO and personality have been investigated with smallassociations between FoMO and Big-5 personality traits (Rozgonjuk et al. 2021 ).8FoMO sen-timent is argued as a motivator for ICOs as perceived scarcity creates an incentive to pur-chase so as not to miss out on the investment opportunity (Karkkainen 2022 ). Personalitydifferences are argued to be common across crypto and stock investors (e.g., openness)given “higher FoMO scores of investors (Bitcoin and share) compared to those of non-investors indicate that the former are more sensitive to rewarding experiences thanthe latter ”(Kim et al. 2020 , 7). Eckel and llbrunn ( 2015 ) highlight a positive correlationbetween aggregate Type-A personality scores (and proportion of male traders) and pricebubbles in experimental asset markets. Finally, regret (Loomes and Sugden 1982 ), or atleast the fear of regret, is linked to FoMO ’s role in purchase likelihood (Good andHyman 2021 ), given FoMO is concerned with failures to act Metz ( 2019 ).92.2. The role of financial literacy and risk toleranceAs previously noted, financial literacy is a positive predictor of stock market participationand stock portfolio diversification (Lusardi and Mitchell 2014 ; van Rooij et al. 2011 b; Yoong2011 ). The evidence for the relationship between financial literacy and crypto participa-tion is less extensive and is inconclusive. For example, a negative relationship is reportedbetween objective financial literacy and crypto ownership (Kim et al. In Press ; Zhao andZhang 2021 , U.S. samples), while a positive relationship is reported using subjective finan-cial literacy and crypto ownership (Arias-Oliva et al. 2019 ; Kim et al. In Press ; Zhao andZhang 2021 , in Spanish and U.S. samples, respectively). Cross-country analysis identifiesa negative relationship between objective financial literacy and investment, notwithstand-ing greater crypto awareness (Panos et al. 2021 ).10Heterogeneity is also evident for crypto,with crypto owners without experience in conventional risky assets having significantlylower objective financial literacy than both crypto owners with experience, and non-crypto owners with conventional risky asset experience (Fujiki 2021 , Japanese sample).7Extraversion 0.23, openness to experience 0.30, agreeableness −0.16, neuroticism −0.13, conscientiousness−0.12.8All but neuroticism (positive) and extraversion (not significant) were negatively associated.9Metz ( 2019 ) notes that “agentially-loaded regret ”may not be “fitting ”(Metz 2019 : 457) in the sense that theindividual may not have the ability (financial literacy) to enable them to act (buy cryptocurrency).10However, they rely on a predicted financial score based on an individual ’s demographic and country profilewhich they acknowledge has limitations but argue it provides an advantage of being an exogenous measure offinancial literacy
	. The problem of endogeneity and bias it can introduce is well established although the directionof the bias is contested (see Fernandes et al. ( 2014 ) and Lusardi and Mitchell ( 2014 ) for example).Journal of Financial Literacy and Wellbeing 107https://doi.org/10.1017/flw.2023.6  Published online by Cambridge University Press
	Financial risk tolerance, or its inverse financial risk aversion (Faff et al. 2008 ), is centralto investment decision-making in addition to its role in the saving and borrowing choicesof individuals and households (Campbell 2006 ). Empirical estimates provide the intuitiveresult that stockholders have higher risk tolerance than non-stockholders (Elminejad et al.2022 ). Crypto investors are identified as more risk-tolerant (Santoso and Modjo 2022 ), rel-atively more risk-seeking (Hackethal et al. 2021 ), and risk-loving (Conlon and McGee 2020 ).2.3. Gender differences in financial literacy, risk tolerance, and FoMOMen are more likely to participate in stock markets (Almenberg and Dreber 2015 ; Bacher2022 ; Kaur and Vohra 2012 ;K e 2021 ; Li et al. 2021 ; van Rooij et al. 2011 b; Lusardi andMitchell 2008 ) and allocate more to stock (e.g., retirement savings Agnew et al. 2003 ;Gerrans et al. 2010 ; Säve-Söderbergh 2012 ). Gender differences in ownership appear moreskewed for crypto. In Australia, a 3:2 male-to-female ratio for stocks (ASX 2020 ) compareswith up to 3:1 for crypto (BTC Markets 2021 ), though less skewed for previous stock invest-ors (35 vs. 49 percent, female vs males). The split is more skewed in the U.K. at 4:1 (Karimand Tomova 2021 ), comparable to Japan (Fujiki 2021 ). Similar differences are indicated inadministrative data for crypto-based products (e.g., contracts for difference and structuredproducts, Hasso et al. 2019 ; Hackethal et al. 2021 ). These contrast with 2019 data fromMalaysia and the Philippines where male vs. female ownership differences are smaller(26 vs. 20 and 34 vs. 30 percent, respectively), and Vietnam where the difference isreversed (38 (female) vs. 32 percent) (OECD 2019 ).The skewed participation profile in stock and crypto investments by gender has drawnconsiderable attention to the underlying basis of the differences, notably the role of finan-cial literacy and risk tolerance.11Lower financial literacy has been proposed as an expla-nation for lower female stock ownership rates (Almenberg and Dreber 2015 ; Bucher-Koenen et al. 2017 ; Lusardi and Mitchell 2014 ). Bucher-Koenen et al. ( 2021 ) and Cupáket al. ( 2021 ) argue a combination of low financial literacy and self-confidence, explainsa large part of the gender gap, while Merkoulova and Veld ( 2022 ) find (ignorance) ofexpected stock returns is a significant part of gender differences in stock investing.Bannier et al. ( 2019 ) report a gender gap in “Bitcoin literacy ”but do not consider its rolein crypto ownership.12As with financial literacy, lower risk tolerance among women(Charness and Gneezy 2012 ; Cupák et al. 2018 ; Dohmen et al. 2011 ; Gneezy et al. 2009 ;Yoong 2011 ) has been used to explain lower participation in risky financial markets (pri-marily stocks), though Nelson ( 2015 ,2016 ) argues that effect sizes are often not substan-tive. For crypto, gender breakdowns are unavailable but overall higher risk tolerance isassociated with crypto investors (Kim et al. 2020 ; Zhao and Zhang 2021 ).13Evidence of gen-der difference in FoMO is not consistent with three meta-analyses reporting no moderat-ing role of gender on FoMO and social media use (Akbari et al. 2021 ; Fioravanti et al. 2021 ;Zhang et al. 2021 ).To summarize, the literature establishes an expectation that FoMO has a positive directeffect on stock and crypto ownership. We expect financial literacy to predict FoMO, andFoMO to have an indirect effect on ownership via higher risk tolerance. We propose genderdifferences in both the level of FoMO and sensitivity to FoMO account for a significantproportion of gender differences in ownership, controlling for risk tolerance and financial11Other variables investigated to account for gender differences include overconfidence (Barber and Odean2001 ), willingness to compete (Croson and Gneezy 2009 ; Flory et al. 2018 ; Niederle and Vesterlund 2011 ), genderidentity norms (Ke 2021 ), optimism (Jacobsen et al
	. 2014 ), income (expectations), and education (Almenberg andDreber 2015 ; Bacher 2022 ).12Financial literacy (actual and perceived) explains 43 percent of the Bitcoin literacy gap (Bannier et al. 2019 ).13Zhao and Zhang ( 2021 ) also find that risk tolerance loses significant when financial literacy is controlled for.108 Paul Gerrans et al.https://doi.org/10.1017/flw.2023.6  Published online by Cambridge University Press
	literacy. We explore whether observed gender differences in FoMO and investing behav-iours are substantive (Nelson 2015 ,2016 ), and we extend the literature by investigatingwhether FoMO explains gender differences, and whether FoMO effects vary by gender.Finally, we expect the role of personality on asset ownership to be mediated by FoMOand risk tolerance.3. Survey and dataTo examine the expectations established in the previous section, we analyze data from asurvey of undergraduate students at The University of Western Australia as part of a pro-gram examining the financial literacy of young adults, including students who enroll in anelective personal finance unit. A link to the online Qualtrics survey was made availablethrough BlackBoard for the week prior to the semester. Those enrolled in the unit receivecourse credit (2%) for survey completion, and all survey participants enter a prize draw forone of ten $50 gift cards. From the 996 completed surveys, 63 from students older than 25years were dropped to maintain a more homogenous age-group. The final sample (52 per-cent female) comprised STEM (52 percent), Humanities and Social Sciences (HASS, 20 per-cent), and Commerce majors (28 percent). Approximately 43 percent of the sampleenrolled in the personal finance unit elective. The sample is more ethnically diverse thanKim et al. ( 2020 ) including 41% Australian/New Zealander, 42% Asian, 7% European/British. The survey was conducted in the last week of July 2021. Crypto and stock priceshad risen substantially in the 12 months prior to the survey in the last week of July 2021.For example, Bitcoin (Ethereum) moved from US$11,810 (US$542) to US$41,697 (US$3,458)in the 12 months ending July 2021, which was nonetheless approximately 50 (40) percentlower than the 12-month peak of US$61,283 (US$4,994) 3 months earlier. Australian stocksalso enjoyed a sustained 12-month rise with the market (All Ordinaries Index) increasingapproximately 26 percent to the end of July 2021.Three sets of FoMO scales were estimated and Panel A in Table 1presents the items foreach. The first included the Personal (five-items) and Social (four-items) dimensions pro-posed by Zhang et al. ( 2020 ). Analysis supported the proposed two-factor structure over asingle-factor structure14and the Cronbach alpha for both dimensions support they arereliable measures (Personal 0.92, Social 0.93). The second set included the adapted invest-ment version of the Personal scale (Adapted Personal) which also indicated a reliable scale(Cronbach alpha 0.94). Table 1indicates that the Social and Personal scales had a mediumcorrelation (0.47, CI 0.42 –0.52)15consistent with Zhang et al. ( 2020 ). The Adapted Personalscale also had a small to medium correlation with the Personal scale (0.40, CI 0.33 –0.46) buta small correlation with Social (0.24, CI 0.16 –0.31). The final set included single-item directmeasures of FoMO. All respondents were asked “To what extent do you fear missing out onthe financial returns on the following investment opportunities if you don ’t invest inthem? Not at all, Slightly, Moderately, Considerably, A Great Deal ”.16In addition to cryptoand stocks, three other assets were also rated: home, gold, and superannuation17(retire-ment savings). Similar to stock and crypto, lower female ownership rates are reported for14χ2(df 1) 2566.96, p-value<0.01.15Based on Fisher ’s transformation. 95 percent confidence intervals.16A referee highlighted a possible concern with question wording in that it could be interpreted as being ofrelevance only for those who currently don ’t invest given it includes “if you do not invest in them ”. Therefore,current investors would select the first two responses. However, the responses suggest respondents interpretedas intended, i.e., to contemplate the case if they don ’t invest, because current investors didn ’t only choose the firsttwo answers. This is consistent with the view of FoMO as a relatively stable trait

	home ownership (CoreLogic 2022 ) and retirement savings in Australia, consistent withinternational evidence (Feng et al. 2019 ). Gold is included as a contrast asset which alsoattracts a lot of attention but is expected to be a small proportion of individual portfolios.Each of the direct measures has a non-significant correlation or does not reach a smallcorrelation size with the Personal or Social scales. Direct Shares18FoMO had a mediumcorrelation (0.48, CI 0.44 –0.54) with direct Crypto FoMO and a similar correlation withAdapted Personal (0.49, CI 0.43 –0.54 and 0.44, CI 0.38 –0.50, respectively). AdaptedPersonal had a small correlation with Home (0.23, CI 0.16 –0.30), Gold (0.24, CI 0.17 –0.31), and Super (0.16, CI 0.09 –0.24). Risk tolerance scores (using the five-item scale ofJacobs-Lawson and Hershey ( 2005 ), Cronbach alpha 0.80) were significantly higher formales (Hedges g0.49, CI 0.37 –0.63). Financial literacy was assessed using the 13-item scaleof Fernandes et al. ( 2014 ) (Kuder-Richardson coefficient of reliability (KR-20) 0.76). The Big-5 personality scores were collected using the 10-item version of Rammstedt ( 2007 )19withSpearman –Brown coefficients across the five dimensions averaging 0.44. In the regressionestimations in the next section, all predictor variables were standardized.4. Analysis and results4.1. Asset ownership and scale summaryMost of the sample have not invested in either shares or crypto (66.2 percent). The small-est group have invested in crypto but not shares (8.6 percent) with 15.1 percent investingin shares but not crypto. Overall, 10.4 percent of respondents have both shares and crypto.Ownership of financial assets is significantly higher among males for both shares (37.3 vs15.9 percent) and crypto (31.6 vs 7.1 percent).20Males also report a higher likelihood(extremely unlikely 1 to extremely likely 5) of future investment in shares (3.87 vs3.01, 0.49 CI 0.36 –0.62)21and crypto (3.01 vs 2.33, Hedge ’sg0.51 CI 0.38 –0.64).22Table 2indicates that many gender differences identified in the literature are evident in the sam-ple. The mean score on the 13-item financial literacy scale is almost two questions higherfor males (7.93 vs 6.13, Hedge ’sg0.62 CI 0.49 –0.76). Consistent with Bucher-Koenen et al.(2021 ), some of the differences may be confidence as females had more “Don ’t Know ”responses (4.17 vs 3.00).23Male risk tolerance is significantly higher (3.8 vs 3.2, Hedge ’sg0.50, CI 0.37 –0.63).Of the three sets of FoMO measures, mean scores are highest for Personal (4.40, range 1to 7) and lowest for Social (3.43, range 1 to 7). Personal and Social scores are positivelycorrelated with social media use though not as strongly (Personal 0.20 and Social 0.09)18In the paper, we have referred to stocks when referring to equity investments. However, the survey ques-tions referred to “shares ”rather than “stocks ”as this is the more common term used in Australia when referringto equity investments. Both in reference to “shares ”shares of a specific company or “shares ”as an asset class.Hence, in the current section and following results section, we refer to “shares ”rather than “stocks ”.19Rammstedt ( 2007 ) find the 10-item scale retains 70% of the full Big-5 scale variance and 85% of retest validity.20Differences in 2021 are larger than revealed in similar surveys of different student cohorts at the University.In the preceding 4 years, the mean shares ownership rate was 27.8 (male) vs 14.2 percent. In 2018, the Bitcoingender split was 19.4 percent (male) vs 4.0.21All reported confidence intervals for effect sizes are at 95 percent level.22Scores are comparable to those from a survey of a different cohort of students at the University in 2018 withsimilarly higher males scores for shares (3.97 vs 3.36). For crypto while the gender pattern is the same, meanswere significantly lower for both (2.2 (males) vs 1.7).23Respondents were asked how many of a subset of four investment questions (subset of the advanced scale ofvan Rooij, et al
	. ( 2011 a) they answered correctly. Males and females under -estimated the number. Mean underes-timation was significantly larger for females (0.68 vs 0.28).

	as reported in Zhang et al. ( 2020 ) (Personal 0.31 and Social 0.19).24In contrast, Direct FoMOShares score are not significantly related with social media use, and the Crypto score has asmall correlation (0.08). Scores for Social and Personal FoMO scales are higher for femalesthough only significant for Social (Hedge ’sg0.18, CI 0.05 –0.31). In contrast, AdaptedPersonal (Hedge ’sg0.31, CI 0.16 –0.46) and Direct Shares FoMO scores (Hedge ’sg0.34,CI 0.21 –0.47) are significantly higher for males. Direct Crypto FoMO scores are also signifi-cantly higher for males (Hedge ’sg0.46, CI 0.33 –0.59). Ranking by mean Direct FoMO scoresshows gender differences again. For males, the highest score is for Shares, whereas forfemales, it is Super followed by Home. Males have significantly higher scores for DirectFoMO Shares (Hedges g0.34, CI 0.21 –0.47) and Direct FoMO Crypto (Hedges g0.46, CI0.33 –0.59).4.2. Current ownership and FoMOTables 3and 4present odds ratios from a logit regression of current shares and cryptoownership, respectively, using the different FoMO scales. Personal and Social FoMO scalesare not significant for shares or crypto ownership. However, both the Adapted Personalscale and the Direct FoMO measures are both significantly positively related to ownershipof both assets. When measured unconditionally, the odds ratios suggest a small to mediumeffect size for FoMO and shares ownership but when other variables are controlled for theeffect size is small.25The odds ratio of owning shares is 1.277 times (1.289) higher for a one-standard deviation (SD) higher Adapted Personal FoMO (Direct FoMO). For crypto, theeffect of FoMO is higher than for shares, but this is sensitive to the choice of FoMO scale.The odds-ratio of ownership is 1.545 times higher based on the Adapted Personal scale or2.156 times higher using Direct FoMO.We do not have access to a large range of additional student demographics, but of thesmall number of controls, age (Age), and ownership of a superannuation account (Super A/C) are weakly positively related to shares ownership. However, for crypto Age is not sig-nificant but Super A/C is. Commerce students are significantly more likely to own shares,at least twice the odds of both their fellow HASS and STEM peers. None of the Big-Fivepersonality traits are significant in directly explaining share ownership though those scor-ing higher on Neuroticism have significantly (weakly) lower odds ratio of owning crypto.A likelihood ratio test of the set of Big-5 variables indicates they do not improve model fitfor either asset. The significantly lower ownership rates for females of shares and crypto isrobust to the inclusion of additional variables. For shares (and using Direct FoMO, secondlast column), the odds ratio of females owning shares is a little more than half that ofmales, controlling for other variables. For shares ownership, including FoMO does not sig-nificantly impact the estimated gender difference (compare last two columns Table 3) con-trary to expectations. Using the decomposition method of Breen et al. ( 2013 ) to account fornon-linear estimation, the reduction in gender effect is approximately 4 percent for sharesand is not significant. For crypto, the odds ratio for female is lower again at 0.294 timesthat of males. Inclusion of FoMO (compare the last two columns of Table 4) significantlyreduces the estimated gender effect by 15 percent.26Financial literacy and risk tolerance are both positively related to owning both assets.Focussing on FoMO Direct results (last three columns), the odds ratio of owning shares is24Social media use was measured as: 1- Less than once a week, 2- A few times a week, 3- Most days (4 to 6 days aweek), 4- 1 to 4 times a day, 5- 5 to 10 times a day, 6- 11 to 20 times a day, and 7- More than 20 times a day.25We utilise the approach of Chinn ( 2000 ) to estimate an effect size using ln(odds ratio)/1.81. For Shares andusing the Direct FoMO scale the effect size is 0
	.14 (CI, 0.03 –0.25). For crypto the equivalent value is 0.42 (CI, 0.31 –0.54).26Estimated with khbin Stata.114 Paul Gerrans et al.https://doi.org/10.1017/flw.2023.6  Published online by Cambridge University Press

Direct and indirect effects –Current ownershipHaving established significant relationships between context-specific (Adapted Personaland Direct) FoMO and asset ownership, the simple model in Figure 1was estimated withresults in Table 5.27In addition to direct effects from FoMO (arrow 1), Risk Tolerance (2),and Financial Literacy (3), indirect effects are expected for Financial Literacy via FoMO onasset ownership (4, 1) and for FoMO via Risk Tolerance on ownership (5, 2). Controls for theBig-Five and Age are included.The Big-Five traits are not significant as direct predictors of shares and crypto owner-ship, apart from a weak negative relationship between Neuroticism and crypto.Extraversion is significantly positively associated with Risk Tolerance. None of the Big-Five traits are significant predictors of FoMO for shares, but Neuroticism is negativelyassociated with FoMO for crypto.28Neuroticism has a negative relationship withFinancial Literacy, as does Agreeableness. Age is a positive and significant predictor ofFoMO Direct Shares but not for FoMO Direct Crypto.294.3.1. SharesThe results support a proposed indirect effect of Financial Literacy in addition to its directeffect. FoMO was expected to result in higher Risk Tolerance and the estimated indirecteffect of FoMO via Risk Tolerance is consistent with this. The direct effect of FoMO on shareownership is significant, but small, with the odds ratio for ownership 1.325 times higherFigure 1.

	for a one-SD higher FoMO. The indirect effect of FoMO via Risk Tolerance is significant andpositive, though small, with the odds ratio 1.180 times higher for a one SD FoMO increase.30In addition to a significant direct effect of Financial Literacy on share ownership, thereis a small indirect effect via FoMO. The direct effect is odds of ownership 1.930 times higherfor a one SD increase in Financial Literacy which exceeds a small effect threshold. Theindirect effect of Financial Literacy via increased FoMO is statistically significant (oddsratio 1.074 times higher) but the size does not reach a small effect threshold. In addition,a significant indirect effect of Financial Literacy extends via FoMO through Risk Tolerancebut the increase (odds ratio 1.043) is not meaningful. Collectively, the indirect effect isapproximately 13 percent of the total effect of Financial Literacy on shares ownership.31FoMO ’s association with share ownership is small (odds ratio 1.326 times higher) with anindirect effect via Risk Tolerance similar (odds ratio 1.322).The estimates reported are average effects, but they can change over their distribution.To investigate, odds ratios and marginal effects for the direct effects were estimated attheir mean and one and two SDs above and below the mean. The top left panel ofFigure 2indicates that for Shares the marginal effect of FoMO is largely constant acrossits distribution. No pairwise comparisons of marginal effects along the distribution aresignificantly different. In contrast, there is a larger change in ownership probability ifthe increase in Financial Literacy or Risk Tolerance is from a higher base level. For exam-ple, starting at a low level (one-SD below the mean) of Financial Literacy (Risk Tolerance),share ownership probability increases by nine (9.5) percentage points if Financial Literacy(Risk Tolerance) increases by one SD. At one SD above the mean, the same increase is asso-ciated with a 19 (25) percentage point change in Financial Literacy (Risk Tolerance).4.3.2. CryptoAs with shares, indirect effects are evident for crypto. A small direct effect estimated forFinancial Literacy is complemented via an indirect effect through FoMO, though not eco-nomically large (crypto ownership odds are 1.070 times higher for an increase in FinancialLiteracy via FoMO). The indirect effect of Financial Literacy through FoMO and RiskTolerance to Crypto ownership is also not meaningful. As previously noted, the directeffect of FoMO on crypto ownership is approximately a medium effect with the odds ratiofor ownership 2.242 times higher given a one-SD FoMO increase. The indirect effect ofFoMO via Risk Tolerance is small. A one SD increase in FoMO has an indirect effect onownership via Risk Tolerance with the odds ratio 1.145 times higher. The lower left panelof Figure 2indicates that the role of FoMO is significantly different across its distribution.At a low FoMO level, one SD below the mean, crypto ownership probability increases byapproximately six percentage points if FoMO increases by one SD. At one SD above themean, the same FoMO increase is associated with a 20-percentage point change.Similar non-linearities are evident with Risk Tolerance and Financial Literacy, thoughmore modestly. For example, for Financial Literacy, the comparable effects on crypto own-ership change from approximately six percentage points to 10, and for Risk Tolerance from6 to 11.In summary, FoMO emerges with the strongest association with current crypto owner-ship, exceeding a small effect size, larger than the role of risk tolerance and financial lit-eracy. In contrast, for shares, FoMO is not economically meaningful relative to the positive30Note that this indirect effect is captured as part of the indirect effect of Financial Literacy previouslydiscussed.31The proportion is estimated by the product of the standardised coefficients to account for the different scal-ing of equations as one outcome is binary and the others continuous (MacKinnon et al
	. 2007 ). Standardizing coef-ficients “equalizes the scales of the coefficients across multiple different logistic regression models to make thecoefficients comparable ”(Rijnhart et al. 2019 , 2).122 Paul Gerrans et al.https://doi.org/10.1017/flw.2023.6  Published online by Cambridge University Press

	roles of risk tolerance and financial literacy. When FoMO is accounted for the estimatedgender difference in share ownership is not significantly reduced, and for crypto, thereduction is only modest.4.3.3. Moderating effectsModerating effects were investigated for gender and current ownership of the other asset.In both cases, a likelihood ratio test rejects a constrained model of equality of effects(Gender: χ2131.85 (27df), p-value<0.01; Own Other Asset: χ2135.32 (27df), p-value<0.01).Differences in ownership probability were compared by the group at each point on thedistribution.32For current share ownership, the gender difference in ownership probabil-ity (higher for males) is evident over the range of each variable but increases significantlywith risk tolerance. For example, the gender difference widens from 7.3 percentage pointsat mean levels of risk tolerance to 15.3 percentage points one SD above the mean ( χ210.4(1df), p-value<0.01). For FoMO and financial literacy, the gender gap significantly widensfor similar changes, but the economic magnitude is small.33FoMO ’s estimated effect onshare ownership is also moderated by ownership of crypto. Those who own crypto havea 14.5 percentage point higher probability of owning shares at a mean level of FoMO whichwidens to 17.0 percentage points at a one SD higher FoMO level ( χ2 14.5 (1df), p-value<0.01). A difficulty here is that ownership of crypto is strongly skewed by gender, as80 percent of those owning crypto are males. Hence, a split by crypto ownership largelyreflects gender differences.For crypto, the effect of FoMO is significantly larger for males and for those currentlyowning shares. For example, at a mean FoMO level, the gender difference in crypto own-ership is 14.3 percentage points but at one SD higher FoMO the gap is 20.4 percentagepoints ( χ234.4 (1df), p-value<0.01), and significantly larger again at two SDs abovethe mean (24.5 percentage points, χ214.0 (1df), p-value<0.01). A gender moderation ofthe positive effect of Financial Literacy is observed. For example, the 14 percentage pointgender difference in predicted crypto ownership at the mean level of Financial Literacyincreases to 22.7 percentage points at two-SDs higher ( χ231.3 (1df), p-value<0.01).This is largely due to the probability for males increases by 13.0 percentage points overthe Financial Literacy increase, whereas for females, the change is 4.2 percentage points.4.3.4. EndogeneityA potential problem with using financial literacy is endogeneity, as while we proposehigher financial literacy predicts asset ownership, financial literacy may be higher dueto ownership. To investigate, an instrumental variable probit regression34is estimatedwith financial literacy instrumented with a measure of whether the participant had com-pleted a business, accounting, or economics-related course at high school. Variations ofthis instrument have been used previously (Lusardi and Mitchell 2007 ; Sekita et al.2022 ; van Rooij et al. 2011 b; van Rooij et al. 2012 ). For both shares and crypto, a Wald-testfails to reject exogeneity (Shares: χ21.01, p-value 0.315; Crypto χ20.96, p-value 0.328).35We32Online Appendix Figure 2(Shares) and Online Appendix Figure 3(Crypto) present plots of probability esti-mates with supporting probability and marginal effects in Online Appendix Table 3and Online Appendix Table 4.33For FoMO, the comparable change sees the gap widen to 9.5 percentage points from 8.1 percentage points ( χ28.5 (1df), p-value<0.01), and for Financial Literacy 9.8 percentage points from 8.5 ( χ27.6 (1df), p-value<0.01).34Using ivprobit in Stata.35The F-statistic of the first stage regressions exceeds the rule-of-thumb value of 10 for weak instruments. Forshares the first-stage F-statistic of 13.648 exceeds the Stock-Yogo weak ID test critical values for a 15% maximal IVsize and for cryptocurrency the first-stage F-stat of 17.558 exceeds the critical value for a 10% maximal IV size

	report the instrumental results in Online Appendix Table 1, but given the failure to rejectexogeneity, we rely on the previous results reported.36As with possible endogeneity of financial literacy, the same question can be asked ofFoMO: does FoMO change once invested? Consistent with the dominant view of FoMOas a latent trait (Przybylski et al. 2013 ; Zhang et al. 2020 ), FoMO has been primarily treated,theoretically, and empirically, as exogenous. A parallel can be drawn with how risk aver-sion is typically treated as a generally stable trait in the empirical literature examiningstock participation (e.g., Bannier and Neubert 2016 ; Cupák et al. 2022 ;Sivaramakrishnan et al. 2017 ; van Rooij et al. 2011 b) notwithstanding the possibility thatrisk aversion may change given the experience of investing.37Using a FoMO scale evalu-ating the stable trait might alleviate endogeneity concerns, whereas using scales adaptedto be more state/context specific may not. The direction of any possible change in FoMO isunclear. Investing in astock or acryptocurrency may reduce anxiety and apprehension forthat specific stock or crypto but leave the predisposition (trait) to feel the anxiety (FoMO)unchanged. Many investors have non-diversified portfolios. For example, in a sample ofAustralian investors, the median number of stocks and cryptocurrencies is three each,and 36 percent of investors hold only one of either (Australian Securities andInvestments Commission 2022 ). Hence, for a majority of investors, there are many stocksand cryptocurrencies remaining to fear missing out on, possibly leaving FoMO unchanged.Conversely, new investments may result in greater awareness of other investment oppor-tunities, possibly amplified by the investment platforms promoting further trades, whichmay increase FoMO. As noted previously, there is no shortage of new offerings promotedby platforms and celebrities targeting potential investors.38This possibility, i.e., the behav-iour begets more FoMO, has been proposed in FoMO-social media literature (e.g., Buglasset al. 2017 ; Bloemen and De Coninck 2020 ). Finally, investments are characterized by theasset and time. In the wake of the collapse of FTX while the number of cryptocurrenciesremained numbered in the many thousands39, a more context-specific (state) FoMO mayhave reduced for prospective investors, just as FoMO focussed on an event which haspassed may wane (Maxwell et al. 2022 ). Resolving these questions will require further lon-gitudinal work, to establish the temporal stability of FoMO in general (Lo Coco et al. 2020 ),and in an investment context, as well as establish the relationship between FoMO andportfolio development and composition.4.4. Future investmentTo investigate whether the relationships for current ownership are reflected in invest-ment intentions, an ordinal logit regression of the likelihood of investing in crypto andshares (Extremely Unlikely (1) to Extremely Likely (5)) was estimated using the36When the marginal effect of financial literacy is estimated with the instruments the estimated effect islarger, consistent with much empirical literature (Christiansen et al. 2007 , Lusardi and Mitchell 2009 ; vanRooij et al. 2011 b, van Rooij et al. 2012 , van Rooij et al. 2011 a, Grohmann et al. 2014 ). For example, the estimatedodds ratio in Table 3(using the Direct FoMO model, second last column) is equivalent to a 6.1 percentage pointsincrease in shares ownership probability for a one SD increase in Financial Literacy. The instrumented regressionestimate is 16.1 percentage points though the significance is weaker as the estimate is less efficient ( p-value 0.083).For ownership of crypto, the estimated odds ratio in Table 4is equivalent to a 3.2 percentage points increase givena one SD increase in Financial Literacy. In the instruments regression the estimated marginal effect is 11.1 per-centage points, but the effect is no longer significant ( p-value 0.179).37Justified by “individual p
	Adapted Personal FoMO and Direct FoMO scores.40The estimations presented in Table 6indicate similar effects as with current ownership. The Big-Five personality traits, Age,Study area, or ownership of superannuation are not significant. Female students are lesslikely to invest (odds of a more likely response are 0.75 times that of males using the Directscale), though this is only weakly significant and reflects a small effect.41Those enrolled inthe personal finance unit are significantly more likely to intend to invest in both assets,potentially reflecting a motivation for unit enrolment. The Direct FoMO scale results inbetter model fit for both assets42, and the estimated FoMO effect is larger and exceedsa medium effect size.For future share ownership, the inclusion of FoMO does not significantly impact theestimated gender difference (columns three and four in Table 6), similar to current shareownership. However, for crypto, there is a large difference with the inclusion of FoMOreducing the estimated gender difference, using the decomposition method of Breenet al. ( 2013 ) to account for non-linear estimation, by an estimated 56 percent (last twocolumns Table 6).4.4.1. Direct and indirect effects –Future investmentTo enable estimation of the same simple model as for current investment, “Extremelylikely ”and “Very likely ”responses were recoded to one with the remaining responsescoded as zero. Recoded this way suggests a high intended share ownership rate (60 per-cent, 70/52 percent male/female) relative to current adult participation rates, which varyfrom 34 percent of the adult population (ASX 2020 ) to 49 percent (Blackburn 2021 ).43However, it is comparable to reported rates among Gen-Z44considering investing inthe future, estimated to be 87/79 percent for males/females. The Direct measures ofFoMO are again used in the estimations, and results are reported in Table 7.45FoMOhas the largest estimated effect, exceeding a medium size effect for shares (0.569, CI0.471 –0.666) and crypto (0.668, CI 0.566 –0.770). The effect of financial literacy is compara-ble to that estimated for current ownership. The odds of future shares ownership are 1.899times higher for a one SD increase in Financial Literacy, which is a small effect (0.354, CI0.256 –0.452). The same increase in Financial Literacy for crypto results in an odds ratio1.330 times higher, which does not reach a small effect threshold (0.157, CI 0.060 –0.254). Risk tolerance has a small positive effect for both shares (0.220, CI 0.118 –0.322)and crypto (0.219, CI 0.122 –0.315).Figure 2presents estimated odds ratios and marginal effects over a range of scores foreach variable to investigate non-linearity of effects. For shares (top right panel), while theodds ratio increases over the range of each variable, the significant variation in marginaleffects is isolated to FoMO. For example, a change in FoMO from one SD below the meanhas a larger marginal effect (22 percentage points) than at one SD higher than the mean (15percentage points, difference χ222.60, p-value<0.01). A similar pattern is observed for40An approximate likelihood-ratio test does not reject the proportional odds assumption (Wolfe and Gould,1998 ).41Equivalent effect size 0.16, CI 0.02 to 0.31.42The sample size is smaller for Adapted Personal regressions. Re-estimating with the same sample, the modelfit remains better for the Direct scale. For shares model fit using the Adapted Personal scale vs Direct scale are R2of 0.412 vs 0.330 and AIC of 1756.1 vs 1838.0. For crypto, the estimates are R20.445 vs 0.243 and AIC of 1815.5 vs2021.2.43In part reflecting a spike of investing through COVID where an estimated 13 percent invested for the firsttime. The ASX ( 2020 ) study reflects those who invest in listed securities.44Those born between 1997 and 2012.45The regressions only differ by outcome variable hence indirect paths estimates, while included in the esti-mation, are not repeated as they remain the same as for current investment as reported in Table 5

	financial literacy though the change is smaller (12 percentage points increase vs 10 per-centage points, difference χ211.63, p-value<0.01). For risk tolerance, estimated marginaleffects do not vary significantly. In sum, while the effects of financial literacy and risktolerance are largely of the same magnitude across their distribution, differences associ-ated with FoMO are larger at low to mean FoMO levels.The lower right panel of Figure 2suggests a similar variation in FoMO for future cryptoinvestment. Larger effects are estimated at already high levels of FoMO. For example, themarginal effect of an increase in FoMO is 28 percentage points at a level one-SD above themean versus 11 percentage points at one-SD below the mean (difference χ249.95, p-value<0.01). None of the variations in estimated marginal effects for financial literacy and risktolerance are significant. As with current ownership, the indirect effect of financial liter-acy via FoMO is larger for shares. The increased odds ratio (1.296 times higher) does notexceed a small effect. Indirect effects of FoMO via risk tolerance are not economicallymeaningful for either shares or crypto.In summary, FoMO has a relatively more significant role in investment intentions forboth assets. Risk tolerance is again positively related to a more likely response, and finan-cial literacy is only significant for future shares investment. Notably, FoMO accounts for alarge (more than half) of the estimated gender difference for crypto responses.4.4.2. Group differencesA likelihood ratio test suggests differences in estimates by gender for shares ( χ2(23df)124.6, p-value <0.01) and crypto ( χ2(23df) 150.95, p-value <0.01).

	on current ownership of each asset also suggested differences for shares ( χ2(23df) 209.56,p-value<0.01) and crypto ( χ2(23df) 243.41, p-value<0.01).46To investigate, future invest-ment probabilities were estimated by gender and current ownership of the asset.47Forfuture share investment, while the level of risk tolerance, financial literacy, and FoMOis significantly higher for males, there is no significant variation in their effect by gender.However, effects are moderated by whether an individual currently owns shares. The over-all effect of FoMO on intention to own shares is larger for those currently owning sharesand varies over FoMO. For example, at higher FoMO (one-SD above the mean), the mar-ginal effect is larger for those who do not currently own shares (15.7 percentage points vs7.0 percentage points, χ219.483, p-value<0.01) whereas at a very low level (two-SDs belowmean) the marginal effect is higher for those who currently own shares (25.5 vs 14.1 per-centage points, χ219.876, p-value<0.01). The effect of financial literacy is also higher forthose owning shares, robust across levels of financial literacy. The effect of risk toleranceon future share ownership is larger for those who currently own shares, driven by largereffects for those not owning shares. That is, for those currently owning shares, increasingrisk tolerance does not result in a higher future probability, whereas it does for those whodo not own shares.For crypto, gender does not moderate effects on future crypto ownership probability.For those currently owning crypto, there is a significantly higher probability of futureinvestment in crypto. Current ownership of crypto moderates the effect of FoMO on futureownership. The marginal effect of FoMO is significantly larger for those currently owningcrypto (24.3 vs 15.6 percentage points, χ219.483, p-value <0.01), indicating that FoMOremains significantly higher given current ownership, and possibly that FoMO doesn ’t dis-sipate with ownership. This is consistent with the limited longitudinal evidence of stableFoMO scores over a 4-month period in a sample of Italian college students (Bonfanti et al.2022 ), and higher FoMO scores 12 months after initial measurement in a sample of ado-lescents (12 –16 years) (Lo Coco et al. 2020 ). The larger FoMO effect for current owners isisolated to those with low (one-SD below the mean) or mean FoMO levels. An increase atthese levels is associated with a larger increase in future probability for current owners of13.9 and 22.0 percentage points, respectively.5. Discussion and conclusionThe use of FoMO in crypto exchange advertisements is an example of how institutionsexpect emotions to play a role in investment decisions. Investment theory, while not dis-counting the role of emotions or “non-portfolio factors ”(Markowitz 1959 : 210), assumesindividuals ’decisions are built on risk-premium expectations, which should result in theirparticipation irrespective of their degree of risk aversion (Campbell 2006 ). For stocks, lackof participation has focussed attention on the role of investor characteristics that establishbarriers, notably financial literacy; investor attitudes that predispose against participa-tion, notably risk aversion/tolerance; and demographics, notably gender. IncludingFoMO builds on work that has established a role for emotions in investment decisions(e.g., Drechsler 2013 ; Durand et al. 2011 ; Uberti et al. 2013 ), and literature examining differ-ences in psychological status and personality between investors and non-investors.Our undergraduate sample has the advantage that it is an age-group over-representedin crypto investment, but the disadvantage is that results may not generalise. Also, our46Estimated with the group option in gsem in Stata and cross-referenced with Process in SPSS using the additionof the group via “w”.

	results are captured by data collection timing as crypto and stock prices had risen sub-stantially over the preceding 12 months, though crypto had also experienced substantialdeclines in the preceding 3 months. Future work can investigate the robustness of resultsto older age groups and to different market conditions. Also, our data are cross-sectionalwhich prevents conclusions of causality and limits our ability to examine endogeneity.Longitudinal FoMO data in an investment context is needed to address this.Consistent with prior evidence, we find significant gender differences in current stock(31 vs 15 percent, males vs females) and crypto investment (31 vs 7 percent, males vsfemales). While scores on context-free FoMO scales (Zhang et al. 2020 ) are higher forfemales, investment-specific FoMO scores are higher for males. While context-free per-sonal and social FoMO scales of Zhang et al. ( 2020 ) correlate with behaviours previouslyinvestigated (i.e., social media use), they do not correlate with stock and crypto invest-ment. However, an adapted investment version of Zhang et al. ’s personal scale does.Single-item direct measures of FoMO (e.g., stocks and crypto) have the strongest correla-tion with current investment behaviour and intentions and using either suggests signifi-cant positive direct FoMO effects. Context matters when examining associations betweenFoMO and investment. While direct FoMO scores are the most informative, a limitation inour analysis is that they were measured with single items. Future work could focus ondeveloping multiple-item direct scales that allow alternative framing, for example, to con-sider current ownership status.Estimates from a simple model of investment identify a significant role for FoMO alongwith financial literacy and risk tolerance for current investment and future investmentintentions for both stocks and crypto. FoMO effects are largest (medium size) for cryptoand for future investment intentions. FoMO effects are the smallest for a current stockinvestment and do not reach a small effect threshold. Risk tolerance and financial literacyhave larger effects than FoMO on current ownership of stocks. While risk tolerance andfinancial literacy have positive effects for current crypto investment, they are small andsmaller than FoMO. Financial literacy retains a significant small effect for future stockinvestment but not for crypto. The role of personality traits in investment behaviourand intentions appears to be accounted for by risk tolerance. Of the Big-5 personalitytraits, only neuroticism is significantly (weakly negative) related to investment (currentcrypto), but extraversion (positive) and neuroticism (negative) are significantly related torisk tolerance. A limitation in our analysis is the use of an abbreviated scale (Rammstedt2007 ), which may result in noisier Big-5 estimates and contribute to our results.In addition to direct effects, financial literacy has an indirect effect on investment viaFoMO, suggesting FoMO has some basis in knowledge though this is a small effect and onlyrobust for stocks. Financial literacy is a significant predictor of FoMO for stocks but onlyweakly for crypto. A role of FoMO via risk tolerance on investment is supported as FoMO isa significant positive predictor of risk tolerance though it is not economically meaningful.FoMO explains only a small amount of gender difference in current crypto ownership,and it does not significantly explain the observed gender difference for stocks. Gendermoderates the effect of risk tolerance on current ownership of stocks as in addition tosignificantly higher average risk tolerance, marginal effects of risk tolerance is largerfor males. For current crypto ownership, FoMO has a larger effect for males and for thosewith experience investing in stocks. Similarly, FoMO ’s effect on crypto investment inten-tions is larger for those who currently own crypto, suggesting FoMO ’s effect does notdissipate.Finally, our paper is agnostic on whether FoMO is good or bad
	. FoMO has been investi-gated primarily within the context of problematic social media use and associated poorhealth outcomes. Our study does not investigate FoMO consequences beyond impactson risk tolerance and investment. To the extent non-participation in stock markets is amistake (Campbell 2016 ), FoMO might serve a positive role.

	associations between financial literacy and FoMO (stocks), this raises interest in the role ofinterventions directly addressing FoMO. For crypto, where the level and marginal effect ofFoMO is larger for males, outcomes such as intensity of participation/trading and conse-quences are of interest.

The study also looks at how FOMO plays a mediating role between herding, loss aversion, overcon-fidence, and crypto investment decisions. To acquire data from crypto retail investors, the study used a questionnaire survey. A total of 473 responses were gathered and analyzed with SmartPLS. To achieve the study’s aims, factor analysis and partial least square struc-tural equation modelling were used. The study’s findings found that FOMO, herding, loss aversion, and overconfidence biases have a substantial effect on the investment decisions of crypto investors, in respective order. In addition, FOMO bias establishes a complemen-tary partial mediation on the relationship between herding, loss aversion, and crypto inves-tors’ decision-making behavior. Ergo, the present study assisted individual and institutional cryptocurrency investors, crypto portfolio managers, policymakers, researchers, and mar -ket regulators in broadening their knowledge base about cryptocurrency and forecasting investors’ behavior.

Moving from simple stock or bond investments in the early 1900s to more complex financial derivatives instruments devel-oped later in the decades, such as securities options, credit default swaps, futures, collater -alized debt obligations, and so on, has incentivized investors with higher investment yields while introducing greater risk. This expansion has been spurred further due to the emer -gence of blockchain-based cryptocurrency (also known as crypto assets), which has gar -nered a lot of attention in the academic world as well as the business community owing to its rise over the last decade (Zhang and Zhang 2022). Its market’s valuation increased at an astounding rate from USD 1.2 billion in 2013 to USD 2.16 trillion at the end of the finan-cial year 2021–2022 (CoinMarketCap 2022). Primitively, the voyage of cryptocurrency started when Satoshi Nakamoto (an anonymous name) invented the first permissionless decentralized currency, Bitcoin, in 2009. The first commercial transaction using Bitcoin took place on May 22, 2010, when Laszlo Hanyecz paid 10,000 bitcoins (about $25) for two pizzas (Hidajat 2019; Arias-Oliva et al. 2019). However, it gained public prominence in 2011 when Julian Assange, the founder of Wikileaks, decided to accept donations in Bitcoin (Porterfield 2012). Subsequently, other crypto-tokens and altcoins such as Name-coin, Litecoin, Ripple, Dogecoin, and so forth have aggressively propelled themselves into the public eye (Sun et al. 2021). Numerous recent studies (e.g., Savelyev 2018; Abubakar et al. 2019; Mikhaylov 2020; Mosteanu and Faccia 2020; Delfabbro et al. 2021) have dem-onstrated that cryptocurrencies have cemented their place in today’s digital world and will undoubtedly play a significant role in practically every investor’s portfolio in the years to come.However, cryptocurrency is a more volatile investment vehicle (Sun et al. 2021) com-pared to conventional asset classes of the stock market like commodities, stocks, and bonds (Subramaniam and Chakraborty 2020), and it is not backed by any government or com-modity (Sood and Singh 2022). Corollary, the fundamental analysis of cryptocurrency investments for return predictability fails (Rubbaniy et al. 2022), whilst non-fundamental approaches such as herding (Gurdgiev and Corbet 2018; Bouri et  al. 2019; Kaiser and Stöckl 2020; Vidal-Tomás et al. 2019; Yarovaya et al. 2021), loss aversion (Popova 2019; Haryanto et al. 2020), and overconfidence (Sudzina et al. 2021; Kim and Hanna 2021; Jalal and Leonelli 2021; Nurbarani and Soepriyanto 2022) emerged as the most prevalent driv -ers in the cryptocurrency market, which makes it more challenging to go through tough periods of downturns and dips. Despite this, the cryptocurrency market is seeing positive momentum day by day. The worldwide crypto market capitalization has surpassed $1.20 trillion, owing to high and consistent trade volumes (Maheshwari 2023). This growing rate of the cryptocurrency market is prompting many new investors to invest in cryptocur -rency, which makes many investors apprehensive that they will lose a good return by not investing in it (Sood et al. 2023a, b). As a result, researchers have observed that the "fear of missing out" (FOMO) approach also has a substantial influence on crypto investors’ investment decisions, along with other biases (e.g., Gupta and Shrivastava 2021). Notwith-standing the significant influence of FOMO on cryptocurrency investors’ investment deci-sions, researchers have failed to examine empirically how various biases in the presence of FOMO affect investors’ decisions to invest more in cryptocurrency.Accordingly, this is the first study that, to the best of the researchers’ knowledge, that has examined how FOMO affects the herding, loss aversion, overconfidence, and overall
	 
	2239“All are investing in Crypto, I fear of being missed out”: examining…1 3decision-making of crypto retail investors with the help of the following research questions (RQs): first, do herding, loss aversion, overconfidence, and FOMO biases have a significant impact on crypto retail investors’ decision-making? Second, does FOMO play a mediating role between herding, loss aversion, and overconfidence biases and crypto investors’ deci-sion-making behavior? Ergo, the purpose of this study is to better understand how herding, loss aversion, overconfidence, and FOMO affect cryptocurrency investment decisions. It also attempts to provide a clear picture of whether FOMO mediates these relationships and, if so, whether it does so partially or fully. Thus, the present study assisted individ-ual and institutional cryptocurrency investors, crypto portfolio managers, policymakers, researchers, and market regulators in broadening their knowledge base about cryptocur -rency and forecasting investors’ behavior. This study also helps the Indian government to make strong policy announcements that allow the cryptocurrency industry to operate in a regulated environment. This would not only increase transparency but also help to detect and limit the exploitation of cryptocurrency via money laundering and other criminal acts. This paves the way for the favourable development of the cryptocurrency market. Hence, this study contributes to the field of behavioral finance.The following are the remaining sections: in the section  2, extant literature has been reviewed along with the formulation of hypothesised relationships. The section 3 entails research methodology to examine the hypotheses and validate the extended model. The section  4 of the paper includes data analysis and interpretation. The sections 5 and 6 describe the discussions and implications. The penultimate section covers conclusions, limitations, and scope for future research.2  Conceptual framework and hypotheses developmentTraditional financial markets hold assumptions, such as the unpredictability of returns (Thies and Molnár 2018) and the risk-return trade-off (Aalborg et al. 2019), for cryptocur -rency, such as Bitcoin, whose returns exhibit statistically significant variances in the risk-return trade-off due to anomalous price volatility regimes (Koutmos and Payne 2021). It increases risks, reduces the stability and robustness of hedging features in this asset class, and introduces behavioral biases into the investment decision-making process of crypto-currency (Hairudin et al. 2020; Mokni et al. 2022), which contribute to market anomalies in the crypto market such as bubbles and crashes (Singh et al. 2021). There are four phases of cryptocurrency bubbles: the stealth, awareness, mania, and blowoff phases (Hoang and Mørken 2018). Some of the behavioral biases thought to be present at each stage of the bubble include herding (stealth phase), optimism (awareness phase), overconfidence (mania phase), and loss aversion (blow-off phase) (Hidajat 2019).This signifies that among the several potential predictors of volatility, a dearth of ration-ality in investment decisions cannot be ruled out as a result of behavioral biases (Cheah and Fry 2015). Hence, this study provides an overview of the relevant literature on distinct behavioral biases that impact individual investors’ decision-making behavior in the crypto market in this section. To justify this phenomenon, the present study used the prospect theory (Kahneman and Tversky 1979), which focuses on investors’ decisions based on risk prospects; the heuristics theory (Tversky and Kahneman 1974), which leads to investors making decisions under uncertainty; and the herding theory (Graham 1999), which empha-sizes that investors rely on another investor’s decision more than their own, from the lit-erature of behavioral finance (Dar and Hakeem 2015). Ergo, the present study takes into 
	2240 M. Kaur et al.1 3consideration herding, loss aversion, and overconfidence as independent variables from the pertinent literature of crypto investors since these are the most prominent biases that are found among crypto investors (e.g., Singh et al. 2017; Gupta and Shrivastava 2021; Chhat-wani and Parija 2023), while crypto investors’ decision-making behavior is an independent variable. However, the primary emphasis of this research is to explore FOMO as a media-tor in the relationship between the herding effect, loss aversion, and overconfidence and crypto investors’ decision-making behavior, as depicted in Fig. 1.2.1  Herding and crypto investment decisionsThe term "herding" was originally studied in zoology and, subsequently, psychology (Har -yanto et al. 2020). Herding is a process in which one economic agent imitates the decisions of others instead of acting independently (Baddeley 2010), which results in the synchro-nization of price co-movements of related financial assets (Caferra 2020). According to Christie and Huang (1995), when opinions converge, result variability decreases because beliefs converge to the prevalent market reaction. This tendency has historically devel-oped during times of financial turbulence, such as the 2008 financial crisis, emphasizing the need to research how the herd instinct affects asset values in financial markets (Hälli 2022). This effect has been proven to be the most ubiquitous behavioral bias in the finan-cial market (Kumar and Goyal 2015) in both advanced (Hwang and Salmon 2004) and emerging economies (Agarwal et al. 2011). Women are more prone to the herding effect than men (Katper et al. 2019; Akhtar and Das 2019). Numerous studies (e.g., Vidal-Tomás et al. 2019; Bouri et al. 2019; Gurdgiev and Loughlin 2020; Rubbaniy et al. 2022; Nur -barani and Soepriyanto 2022) have confirmed the significant impact of herding on crypto investors. Poyser (2018) investigated herding behavioral under symmetric and asymmetric conditions, claiming that herding drives cryptocurrency values. According to Ballis and Drakos (2020), herding was shown to be more pronounced in a bullish market. In contrast, da Gama et al. (2019) found that when the market is bearish, there is a herding effect. How -ever, Haryanto et al. (2020) observed that herding follows the market trend. When the bit-coin price rises, herding becomes more prevalent in both bullish and bearish periods. Thus, the first hypothesis of the study is:Fig. 1  Conceptual model. Source: Authors’ Compilation
	2241“All are investing in Crypto, I fear of being missed out”: examining…1 3H1 Herding has a significant influence on crypto investment decisions.2.2  Loss aversion and crypto investment decisionsInvestors are often more apprehensive about any losses they may experience as the decisions they make regarding their investments have an impact on their family’s finan-cial condition. In prospect theory, this is known as loss aversion (Barberis et al. 2003). Shefrin and Statman (1985) were the first to describe this phenomenon, claiming that most people seek to sell financial assets that have recently acquired a stronger position than those that are in a weaker position. In other words, investors prefer to sell winning assets in order to maximize gains in the probability that prices fall in the future (Dar and Hakeem 2015) because they hate losses and prefer to conserve capital rather than focus on increasing it (Jain et al. 2021). Male investors are less risk-averse than female inves-tors (Hassan et al. 2014; Gonzalez-Igual et al. 2018). Prior studies (e.g., Popova 2019; Haryanto et al. 2020) have demonstrated that individual investors’ investment decisions in the crypto market are influenced by loss aversion bias, which can manifest itself dur -ing the blow-off phase when investors who have lost money due to price drops continue to hold Bitcoin because they think that they will suffer greatly if they sell it at a loss (Hidajat 2019). Loss aversion causes disposition effects, in which investors continue to lose capital to avoid getting upset (Rau 2014). The negative disposition effect occurs when bitcoin prices have been rising (during bullish times), but the positive disposition effect occurs when bitcoin prices have been falling (during bearish periods) (Haryanto et al. 2020). Thus, the second hypothesis of the study is:H2 Loss aversion has a significant influence on crypto investment decisions.2.3  Overconfidence and crypto investment decisionsOverconfidence is a phenomenon that occurs when individuals believe they know more than others (Pompian 2006). They consider their judgement superior to others’ (Jain et al. 2015) and feel that they know more than they can do (Shiller 2000). Overconfi-dence is often related to numerous words in the economic literature, like "better-than-average effect," “illusion of control," "miscalibration," and "unrealistic optimism" (Glaser and Weber 2007). People demonstrate overconfidence in their knowledge, com-petence, and skills while investing in the financial market, which is inextricably linked with optimism (Poyser 2018). Many investors are optimistic regarding their knowledge of investments and overlook the risks involved (Jain et al. 2021). Women are less con-fident in their investment decisions than men due to a lot of societal pressure (Pulford and Colman 1997; Hira and Loibl 2008). When the price of Bitcoin reaches an all-time high during the mania phase, investors think they have superior knowledge and capac-ity to discern which cryptocurrencies to invest in (Hidajat 2019). As a result, they are more likely to invest in cryptocurrency (Jalal and Leonelli 2021; Kim and Hanna 2021; Sudzina et al. 2021; Nurbarani and Soepriyanto 2022). Thus, the third hypothesis of the study is:H3 Overconfidence has a significant influence on crypto investment decisions.
	2242 M. Kaur et al.1 32.4  FOMO and crypto investment decisionsThe term "fear of missing out" (FOMO) was coined in 2004 to characterize a behav -ior identified on social networking sites (Gupta and Sharma 2021), where it is associ-ated with the dread and anxiousness of missing out on crucial information and break -throughs due to not being constantly connected to social media (Przybylski et al. 2013). In the context of investment decisions, FOMO bias arises when investors notice that other investors are entering the market or targeting specific financial instruments, as they believe they should do the same or risk missing out on the opportunity (Hersh-field 2020a, b). They are prompted by a desire to increase their earnings; therefore, they attempt not to miss out on any chance to make prospective gains (Kang et al. 2020). Hysteria erupted in the market when cryptocurrencies were unveiled, with everyone wanting to invest in these digital currencies (Denison et  al. 2019). It was also found that many investors didn’t have much idea about cryptocurrency, but fear of missing out caused them to invest in it blindly (Gupta and Shrivastava 2021). Ergo, FOMO does affect investing decisions, whether deliberately or unwittingly (Martin et  al. 2022). There have been a few studies (e.g., Baur and Dimpfl 2018; Delfabbro et al. 2021; Zhang and Mani 2021; Martin et  al. 2022; Bonaparte 2022) that discussed FOMO in cryp-tocurrency investment decisions. According to Zhang and Mani (2021), positive mar -ket shocks have a bigger influence on the volatility of these financial assets than nega-tive shocks of equal magnitude due to the FOMO effect. Some studies have shown that women experience more FOMO than men (Stead and Bibby 2017; Beyens et al. 2016), although Przybylski et al. (2013) discovered the contrary. Thus, the fourth hypothesis of the study is:H4 FOMO has a significant influence on crypto investment decisions.2.5  FOMO as mediatorFOMO’s relationship with herding, loss aversion, and overconfidence in various contexts has been validated by several studies in the past (e.g., Kang et al. 2020; Tarjanne 2020; Gupta and Shrivastava 2021). The authors of these studies stated that FOMO drives people to collectively consume products in order to get psychological consolation. Many individu-als are more inclined to invest in investment instruments when they notice that their friends and colleagues are thriving in the financial market. As a consequence, FOMO predomi-nates, which causes herd behavior and constantly drives financial asset prices up (Hersh-field 2020a, b). Denison et  al. (2019) identified FOMO as a strong driver to encourage investors to make quick investment decisions in order to keep up with their neighbors and colleagues. The author also highlighted that many investors are overly impulsive in order to get high returns immediately and avoid future losses. The presence of FOMO considerably amplifies the effect of loss aversion and herding on investors’ investment decisions. This indicates that while individual investors may normally demonstrate some extent of herding effect or loss aversion while taking investment decisions, if they are predisposed to FOMO, their investment decisions will be considerably more influenced by herd behavior or loss aversion (Gupta and Shrivastava 2021). In the context of overconfidence bias, Liu (2019a, b) discovered that less confident investors are more susceptible to the FOMO effect, since people lack confidence when they are unsure of whether they should invest in a particular financial asset or not, but due to the FOMO effect, they are willing to do so. On the other side, when an investor is more confident about their investment, they continue it with the 
	2243“All are investing in Crypto, I fear of being missed out”: examining…1 3expectation that they will undoubtedly receive a high return. Thus, the projected hypoth-eses of the study are:H5 Herding has a significant influence on FOMO in crypto investment decisions.H6 Loss aversion has a significant influence on FOMO in crypto investment decisions.H7 Overconfidence has a significant influence on FOMO in crypto investment decisions.H8 FOMO among cryptocurrency investors mediates the relationship between herding and crypto investment decisions.H9 FOMO among cryptocurrency investors mediates the relationship between loss aver -sion and crypto investment decisions.H10 FOMO among cryptocurrency retail investors does not mediate the relationship between overconfidence and crypto investment decisions.3  Research methodology3.1  Evaluation frameworkThe current study was intently interested in examining the effect of behavioral biases on investment decisions of those crypto investors who have a minimum of 2 years of invest-ment experience in crypto market, as experienced investors make sound investment deci-sions based on value criteria (Korniotis and Kumar 2011) and their investment techniques may undergo significant change (Tripathi 2008). A measurement scale for the present study was devised after an extensive analysis of the pertinent literature, in which various con-structs and their corresponding items were chosen. To confirm the validity of various latent constructs and their items and to certify that the dimensions of the constructs are suitably worded and understandable, the present study deployed pre-testing methods, such as semi-structured interviews of two academic experts, one financial expert, and five experienced crypto investors. Their suggestions and opinions were considered to the greatest extent possible without affecting the nature of the questions. Thenceforth, data was collected from the respondents using a 7-point Likert scale with the options of "strongly disagree" to "strongly agree."3.2  Designing of questionnaireTo collect primary data from crypto investors, a structured questionnaire was used. The questionnaire used in the study was labelled, "The objective of this survey is to collect tangible information about how behavioral biases impact crypto investors’ investment deci-sions." The questionnaire was divided into two sections. Section I included 8 questions related to the demographic information of the respondents, such as gender, age, education, occupation, annual income, investment experience, percentage of income invested, and fre-quency of investment. Section II incorporated 24 items related to various constructs of the study, namely, herding, loss aversion, overconfidence, FOMO, and cryptocurrency invest-ment decisions, extracted from relevant literature, i.e., Gupta and Shrivastava (2021), Jain et al. (2021), Liu (2019a, b); and Luong and Thu Ha (2011) (see “ Appendix”). However, in accordance with the study’s aims and focus, the scale was later amended in accordance with the guidelines given by Netemeyer et al. (2003).
	2244 M. Kaur et al.1 33.3  Data collectionCrypto investment in India is mostly driven by the Generation Z and millennial popula-tions. According to the report of homegrown crypto exchange CoinSwitch, the vast major -ity of crypto investors in the nation are between the ages of 18–25 and 26–35 (CoinSwitch 2022). Therefore, the present study’s population included crypto retail investors from the north Indian region, namely Jammu and Kashmir, Delhi NCR, Himachal Pradesh, Hary -ana, Punjab, Uttarakhand, and Chandigarh, due to its diverse culture and more young pop-ulation (see Singh et al. 2017; Kaur et al. 2021). In addition, Bhaskar (2016) reported that the North Indian consumers are rich and tech savvy who easily adapt online services. Even north Indian females use more digital technology as compared to other regions (Tech2 2016). A snowball sampling technique was deployed to collect primary data. Snowball sampling is a non-probability sampling technique that is best suited for those research stud-ies where a specific type of population is required but it is difficult to access and there is an interconnected network of people or organizations (Sood et al. 2022; Nardi 2006). In the present study, the population was of a specific type, i.e., crypto investors, and they belonged to an interconnected system of crypto exchanges. Two qualifying questions were asked at the outset of the survey: (1) Are you aware of cryptocurrency? (2) Do you have at least 2 years of experience in cryptocurrency investment? Those who responded "yes" were given access to the whole questionnaire. A total of 689 individual crypto investors of dif-ferent ages, geographies, and investment corpuses were solicited physically and electroni-cally (via email, WhatsApp, and Telegram) during a four-month period, from July 2022 to October 2022. In addition, several personal and telephone interviews were carried out to help respondents better comprehend the concepts and questions by taking time from them at their convenience. Regular reminders were also sent out to ensure that the data was collected on time. A total of 541 crypto investors responded positively to the ques-tionnaire, out of which 68 were found to be incomplete or invalid. Therefore, it has been removed from the final analysis. The remaining 473 responses are considered for final anal-ysis, resulting in a response rate of 68.65% (as shown in Table  1). It has been documented that the Cochran (1963) formula was used to calculate sample size, which is acceptable when the population is large or infinite (Israel 1992). Further, to confirm the appropriate-ness of the sample size, G*Power (Faul et al. 2009) was used, which indicated 125 as the minimum sample required to attain statistical power of 99%. Similar researchers in the past (e.g., Sharma et al. 2022) have also conducted their study in the crypto domain with an approximate similar sample size.3.4  Participants descriptionMale investors composed 79.7% of the 467 respondents, while female investors accounted for the remaining 20.3%. Furthermore, the majority of investors, 43.3%, were found to be between the ages of 30–40. This reveals that the crypto investment market is dominated by young and male investors, which is consistent with Steinmetz et al. (2021)’s and Auer and Tercero-Lucas (2022)’s  findings, who reported that the majority of crypto investors are young and male. In addition, 49% of respondents were postgraduates, while 36.6% were graduates. Further -more, 49.2% of respondents were self-employed, while 33% were salaried. In terms of annual income, 35.3% of respondents earn between 10 to 15 lakhs, while 26% earn between 5 to10 lakhs. This suggests that highly qualified investors with good earnings are more likely to invest in cryptocurrencies. When it comes to investment experience, 85.6% of investors have 2 to 
	2245“All are investing in Crypto, I fear of being missed out”: examining…1 35 years of experience. This implies that the subjects of research are experienced in the crypto market. This ensured more consistent outcomes, as experience has a positive influence on investment skills (Korniotis and Kumar 2011). Additionally, 52% of respondents reported that they are investing approximately 10% to 20% of their incomes in the crypto market. Another intriguing conclusion was that the majority of investors, i.e., 58.3%, invest in cryptocurren-cies on a monthly basis. This shows that the preponderance of investors in the cryptocurrency market are active investors.

	2246 M. Kaur et al.1 34  Data analysis and interpretation4.1  Common method biasWhile carrying out behavioral studies, when data for both endogenous and exogenous constructs is collected through a single instrument, it is a must to check the presence of common method bias (CMB) problem (Kock 2015). In the present study, CMB was meas-ured using a Harman single factor, in which all the items of endogenous and exogenous constructs were loaded into a single factor using exploratory factor analysis, which takes into account variances of less than 50% (Streukens et al. 2017). Using unrotated principal component analysis, it was found that a single factor made up of all the items explained 41.938% of the variance in the current study. This shows that there is no CMB.4.2  Measurement model assessmentThe measurement model of the present research has five latent constructs: herding, loss aversion, overconfidence, FOMO, and investment decisions (as shown in Fig.  2). In the measurement model, reliability and validity of exogenous and endogenous variables were assessed using SmartPLS (version 4.0.8.7), which includes indicator reliability, construct reliability, convergent validity, and discriminant validity. Indicator reliability is acquired by squaring the outer loadings of reflective constructs, which describe the relationship between the latent variables and their measurements (Ringle et al. 2015). When the outer loadings of all items are above the threshold value of 0.708 (Hair et al. 2016), indicator reliability is assured, as shown in Table  2. To test construct reliability, composite reliabil-ity, and Cronbach’s alpha were determined; the values of both should be in the range of 0.7 and 0.95 (Diamantopoulos et al. 2012). This was assured in the current study since the Cronbach’s alpha and composite reliability values were both within the prescribed range. For establishing convergent reliability, the average variance extracted (AVE) was found by averaging the square of each construct’s outer loadings, which must be greater than 0.5 Fig. 2  Measurement model

This was confirmed by the fact that the AVE of all constructs was greater than 0.5, as shown in Table 2.Further, the discriminant validity of the model was analysed using two criteria (Table  3). The first criteria is to check the heterotrait-monotrait (HTMT) criterion, which should be less than 0.85 for all constructs (Henseler et al. 2016), displayed in Table  3, which confirms the discriminant validity of the constructs. Another criterion suggested by Fornell and Larcker (1981) was also used to assess discriminant validity. In this method, correlation among constructs should be less than the square root of AVE for every construct (Ringle et al. 2015), which was achieved as shown in Table 4.4.3  Structural model assessmentBefore testing a hypothesis, the first step in evaluating a structural model is to look at issues of multicollinearity. Diamantopoulos and Siguaw (2006) stated that high intercor -relation between variables is the main cause of multicollinearity in any model. Variance inflation factor (VIF) is the standard approach for determining if a model has multicol-linearity issues (Diamantopoulos and Siguaw 2006). The values of VIF must be less than 5, which is a reliable indicator of the truancy of multicollinearity issues in a model (Hair et al. 2017). In this study, all of the VIF values for the predictor variables were less than 5, which shows that there were no issues of multicollinearity in the inner model. The sec-ond step is to put the study’s hypotheses to the test through the bootstrapping technique in SmartPLS. Bootstrapping is a resampling technique performed with a subsample size of 5,000 since a large sample size assures reduced variance between the original and mean values of regression path coefficients. Besides, it helps in ensuring the stability of estimates (Davcik 2014). Ergo, it generated path coefficients, p values, and t-statistics, which are dis-played in Table 5.Table 3  HTMT criterion.

	2250 M. Kaur et al.1 3The structural model of the research is displayed in Fig.  3. The study’s results showed that all four behavior biases—herding (HD), loss aversion (LA), overconfidence (OC), and fear of missing out (FOMO)—have a positive and significant effect on crypto investment decisions (CID), which supports H1, H2, H3, and H4 (as shown in Table  5). In this context, FOMO (b = 0.298, t = 6.322) has the greatest influence on crypto investment decisions among the four biases, followed by HD (b = 0.246, t = 4.575), LA (b = 0.196, t = 4.26), and OC (b = 0.189, t = 3.726). As far as H5, H6, and H7 are concerned, full statistical support was found for all of them, which stated that all three behavioral biases, i.e., HD, LA, and OC, were found to have a significant positive impact on FOMO. Out of them, LA (b = 0.486, t = 12.721) has the most substantial influence of FOMO, followed by HD (b = 0.257, t = 6.022) and OC (b = 0.124, t = 3.262). To ana-lyze the mediating effect of FOMO on the relationship between behavior biases, namely, herding, loss aversion, and overconfidence bias, and crypto investment decisions, Nitzl Table 5  Path analysis.

(2017) guidelines were followed in the present study.The indirect effects of HD (b = 0.077), LA (b = 0.145), and OC (b = 0.037) were found to be significant, as shown in Table  5. The total effect of HD on CID was also significant, with b = 0.323 and t = 6.006. Similarly, the total effect of OC (b = 0.226, t = 4.468) and LA (b = 0.341, t = 7.167) on CID was also found to be significant. The strength of the mediation as per guidelines given by Nitzl et al. (2016) was analyzed, and Variance Accounted For (VAF) values (shown in Table  5) were also calculated by dividing indirect effect by total effect for every relationship. If VAF is less than 20%, nearly zero mediation occurs; if VAF is greater than 20% but less than 80%, it could be characterized as a typical partial mediation; and a VAF above 80% indicates a full mediation (Nitzl et al. 2016). Hence, in the present research, VAF values conclude par -tial mediation in the case of LA and HD, whereas FOMO was not found to be mediating the relationship between OC and CID as the VAF value is less than 20%. The signs of direct and indirect effects for both HD and LA are positive. As a result, a complemen-tary partial mediation of FOMO bias on the relationship between HD, LA and CID has been established.When the impact of LA, HD, and OC on CID was checked without using FOMO as a mediator, R2 was found to be 43%. The addition of FOMO as a mediator to the model increased R2 to 0.479, indicating that 48% of the variance in CID is explained by HD, LA, OC, and FOMO, indicating good predictive precision of the model (Hair et al. 2019). Further  Q2 and PLS predict were analyzed to assess the predictive relevance of the model as per the guidelines given by Shmueli et al. (2019), and the results are shown in Table  6.  Q2 predict values for the PLS model are greater than 0 for all items of CID, the endogenous construct. PLS RMSE values should be compared with LM RMSE values if PLS MV prediction errors of endogenous constructs are symmetric; otherwise, PLS MAE values should be compared with LM MAE values to check the predictive relevance of the model (Shmueli et al. 2019). PLS MV prediction errors (as shown in Fig.  4) were analysed for all indicators of CID and found to be non-symmetric by obser -vation. Hence, PLS MAE values were compared with LM MAE values for all indicators of CID. The results are displayed in Table  6. If PLS values are greater than LM values for all the indicators, then the model shows high predictive power, whereas if it happens for half or more than half of all indicators, medium predictive power is proved (Shmueli et al. 2019). For half of the indicators, PLS MAE values were smaller than LM MAE values, signifying medium predictive relevance of the model (Shmueli et al. 2019).Table 6  Results of PLS predict.

	2252 M. Kaur et al.1 34.4  Robustness checkTo check the robustness of the specified model, the guidelines mentioned by Sarstedt et al. (2020) were followed. Results of any research are considered robust if non-linearity and endogeneity are not present in the model. Thus, firstly, potential nonlinearities were checked in the structural model relationships. The quadratic effects of HD, OC, and LA on CID, as well as FOMO and the effects of FOMO on CID, were represented by interaction terms. Bootstrapping was run with 5000 subsamples. The interaction effects of all exog-enous constructs, i.e., HD (p value = 0.420), OC (p value = 0.100), and LA (p value = 0.27) on FOMO were found to be insignificant. Similarly, the interaction effects of all exogenous constructs on CID were found to be insignificant, including HD (p value = 0.128), OC (p value = 0.63), LA (p value = 0.15), and FOMO (p value = 0.821). Non-linear relationships were not found in the model because the quadratic effects for all constructs were insignifi-cant. Secondly, the model was checked for endogeneity. For this Park and Gupta’s (2012), Gaussian Coupla approach was used. All combinations of Gaussian copulas included in the model were checked, and none were found to be significant (as shown in Table  7). Hence, Fig. 4  PLS MV prediction errors for indicators of Crypto investment decisions
	2253“All are investing in Crypto, I fear of being missed out”: examining…1 3it can be concluded that endogeneity is not present in this study, which supports the robust-ness of the structural model results of the present research (Hult et al. 2018). Ergo, robust-ness was ensured in terms of nonlinear effects and endogeneity.5  DiscussionsThe study has undertaken the effort to examine how herding, loss aversion, overconfidence, and FOMO affect the investment choices made by cryptocurrency investors. Although there is a dearth of primary research on the behavior biases that influence the investment choices of crypto investors, this study goes a step further by conducting a field survey and analyzing the mediating effect of FOMO in the relationship between herding, loss aversion, overconfidence, and the decision-making behavior of crypto investors. The current study’s findings show that all four variables have a considerable effect, with FOMO having the strongest influence on the investment decisions of crypto investors, followed by herding, loss aversion, and overconfidence, respectively. In the context of FOMO, respondents of the study have opined that when they see other investors entering the cryptocurrency mar -ket, it makes them feel pushed to do the same so as not to miss out on the lucrative returns that others are obtaining. This tendency leads individuals to invest without thinking criti-cally, and they occasionally drown. This finding is consistent with previous research stud-ies (e.g., Baur and Dimpfl 2018; Delfabbro et al. 2021; Zhang and Mani 2021; Bonaparte 2022; Martin et al. 2022).The study outcome has also stated that herding is rapidly growing in the cryptocurrency market as a result of market stress, significant price volatility, a lack of quality information, and cryptocurrency investors’ expectations of unprecedented positive returns. This suggests that cryptocurrency investors do not make investment decisions in isolation. Instead, they discuss cryptocurrency investment with folks that have the most influence on their think -ing process and are easily influenced by them. Many investors believe that if the majority of investors’ decisions are sound, they will experience substantial returns and avoid losses; therefore, they base their investment decisions on how other investors choose to hold their Table 7  Assessment of endogeneity test using the Gaussian copula approachTest Construct Coefficient p valueGaussian copula of model 1 (HD) HD 0.073 0.833Gaussian copula of model 2 (OC) OC − 0.281 0.159Gaussian copula of model 3 (LA) LA 0.212 0.245Gaussian copula of model 4 (FOMO) FOMO 0.022 0.89Gaussian copula of model 5 (HD and OC) HD 0.116 0.738OC − 0.289 0.155Gaussian copula of model 6 (OC and LA) OC − 0.297 0.141LA 0.223 0.219Gaussian copula of model 7 (LA and FOMO) LA 0.219 0.226FOMO 0.058 0.71Gaussian copula of model 8 (FOMO and HD) FOMO 0.018 0.914HD 0.069 0.846Gaussian copula of model 9 (HD, OC and LA) HD 0.093 0.794

This finding is consistent with previous research studies (e.g., Vidal-Tomás et al. 2019; Bouri et al. 2019; Gurdgiev and Loughlin 2020; Rubbaniy et al. 2022; Nurbarani and Soepriyanto 2022). Moreover, respondents of the study have opinion-ated that whenever they get a chance to earn a potential gain, they become risk averse due to cryptocurrency market volatility and book the profit. On the other hand, they recognise that whenever they face losses, they are putting themselves at unnecessary risk. In short, they are generally more inclined toward avoiding losses than earning profits. As a result of their hasty decisions in the cryptocurrency market in order to minimise losses, investors suffer massive losses. This finding is consistent with Popova (2019) and Haryanto et al. (2020).Additionally, the study’s results have indicated that cryptocurrency investors are also overconfident in their investment decisions. Overconfidence is unquestionably connected to risky crypto investments, and overconfident individuals are lured into high-risk endeavours since they think that they know when to enter or exit the crypto market. Besides, they are overly optimistic about their skills in a certain scenario. However, overconfident investors do not prepare for any type of uncertainty, which puts them at risk of large losses some-times (Jain et  al. 2021). Various research studies (e.g., Kim and Hanna 2021; Jalal and Leonelli 2021; Sudzina et al. 2021; Nurbarani and Soepriyanto 2022) are consistent with this finding of the present study. Additionally, the present study has a substantial focus on the mediating effect of FOMO bias on the relationship between herding, loss aversion, overconfidence, and crypto investment decisions. In this regard, the findings of the research indicated that herding, loss aversion, and overconfidence play a substantial role in crypto investment decisions even in the absence of FOMO. However, because of the presence of FOMO bias, the impact of herding and loss aversion biases on crypto investment decisions has been greatly amplified, while the impact of overconfidence has not. The reasoning behind this finding is that because FOMO causes market deception, one should invest in cryptocurrencies; otherwise, they will miss out on earning a return. As a result, individuals are beginning to follow other people more and act on their recommendations. Furthermore, due to FOMO bias, many crypto investors become extremely aggressive in order to gain large profits quickly and prevent future losses. Overconfident crypto investors, on the other hand, are sure that they will do better than where they invest, so they don’t worry about missing any opportunities.6  Implications6.1  Theoretical implicationsOver the past many years, behavioral finance has led to a better understanding of actual investor behavior and real-world market practices, and it is likely to make substantial future developments (Delfabbro et al. 2021). Consequently, the study broadens theoretical contri-butions in the realm of behavioral finance and related theories, such as prospect, heuristic, and herding, by extending an understanding of how investors behave while investing in the cryptocurrency market with the additional element of FOMO. Herding, loss aversion, and overconfidence biases cause behavioral anomalies in the crypto market since investors rely on collective information and neglect real facts when making investments. Ergo, a better understanding of these critical biases and investors’ behavior due to the presence of FOMO bias fills a gap in the present research. Furthermore, the current study adds new insights to 
	2255“All are investing in Crypto, I fear of being missed out”: examining…1 3traditional quantitative models such as the modern portfolio theory (MPT), efficient market theory (EMT), arbitrage pricing theory (APT), and capital asset pricing model (CAPM), which assume that individual investors make perfectly rational decisions. However, in the real world, no perfect rationality exists no matter how much experience an investor has, since rationality is limited when an individual makes investment decisions due to cogni-tive limitations such as limitations of knowledge, resources, computational capacity, and time constraints, as well as the emotional biases of the decision-makers, which are tricky to control or change, especially during market turbulence (Pompain 2012). Thus, this research encourages all types of cryptocurrency investors and financial experts to recognize that understanding behavioral finance concepts and theories is critical for understanding the decision-making behavior of crypto investors.6.2  Practical implicationsThis study has practical implications for individual and institutional cryptocurrency inves-tors, crypto portfolio managers, policymakers, researchers, market regulators, and society at large. First, the findings of the present study enable investors to comprehend how their own psychological factors influence their choice of investments. Hence, when selecting investment avenues, cryptocurrency investors should take into consideration the influ-ence of critical biases such as herding, loss aversion, overconfidence, and FOMO. This can increase their understanding of the possible financial pitfalls of cryptocurrency caused by behavior biases, which would aid in achieving an optimal return on investment and avoid-ing any potential errors in judgment. Second, this study helps crypto portfolio managers who keep an eye on bitcoin and many altcoins figure out which behavior biases affect cryp-tocurrency investors the most. This lets them give their clients the best investment advice. Third, this research provides policymakers with valuable information and expertise on the behavioral aspects of individual investors, helping them to make the best decisions and methods for crypto investors to enhance cryptocurrency investment among Indian inves-tors. Policymakers would be better equipped to judge the necessity of cryptocurrency regu-lations if they understood how investors make decisions. Fourth, the study is useful for both researchers and academicians because it helps them to understand them how distinct psychology of cryptocurrency investor. Fifth, this research helps the market regulators to make stronger laws and regulations that are required to limit the influence of behav -ior biases on crypto investors’ decision-making and offer investors a more secure invest-ing environment. These laws ultimately help the Indian government with the enactment of comprehensive policy announcements that allow the cryptocurrency industry to operate in a regulated environment (Tambe and Jain 2023). In this regard, the Finance Ministry has taken a comprehensive step by including cryptocurrency under the ambit of the “Pre-vention of Money Laundering Act” (PMLA) (Chadha 2023). This implies that custodians, exchanges, and wallet providers, among others, engaged in crypto-related trade will be sub-ject to the PMLA (Chadha 2023). Due to this law, crypto companies will now be required to carry out their operations with more due diligence, which can help keep the crypto mar -ket stable and lower the risk for investors in cryptocurrencies in the long run. This would not only increase transparency but also help to detect and limit the exploitation of crypto-currency via money laundering and other criminal acts. This paves the way for the favour -able development of the cryptocurrency market. It may help stop people from speculating on cryptocurrency, which would control behavioral biases and make cryptocurrency a good way to invest that adds to the gross domestic product (GDP) and helps society

	2256 M. Kaur et al.1 37  Conclusion, limitations, and scope for future researchSince the RBI lifted its ban on investing in cryptocurrencies in March 2020, there has been a huge increase in them. Indian exchanges have seen a lot of new users join, and their daily trading volumes keep going up (Saundal 2021). Even though investing in cryptocurrencies has gone through the roof, it is very risky and has a high risk-to-reward ratio (Fonseca et  al. 2019). One of the main reasons why cryptocurrency prices change a lot is because of how investors’ emotions affect their decisions. In this context, the current study looked at the most significant behavioral factors, like herding, loss aversion, overconfidence, and fear of missing out (FOMO), that affect how cryptocurrency investors choose to invest their money. The study has also looked at how FOMO affects herding, loss aversion, overconfidence, and the decisions peo-ple make about investing in crypto. The results of the study showed that each of the four biases has a big effect on how cryptocurrency investors choose where to put their money. Unexpectedly, FOMO has turned out to be the most influential bias, followed by herding, loss aversion, and overconfidence, in that order. In addition, FOMO bias establishes a complementary partial mediation between herding, loss aversion, over -confidence, and crypto investment decisions. In conclusion, this study has shown that behavioral factors, when combined with other factors, are an important phenomenon that should be studied regularly to understand how crypto investors make decisions, since these factors affect the investors’ portfolios, the market, and the economy as a whole.However, there are certain limitations attached to the present study. First, the data has been collected from those individuals who have invested continuously in crypto-currencies for at least two years; hence, only experienced participants were included in this study. A future study might be conducted on novel investors as well. Second, the study was confined to individual crypto investors in one country, India, and one finan-cial market. Therefore, there is a need to exercise caution when projecting the findings to other regions. Future research might be undertaken in overseas markets with differ -ent populations, such as professional crypto investors. Third, the study’s findings are based on a sample of north Indian crypto investors. As a result, future research may be undertaken using countrywide data. Fourth, the study solely looked at the herding effect, loss aversion, and overconfidence. Other heuristics and prospect biases can be studied in the future to see how they affect cryptocurrency investment decisions in the presence of FOMO bias. In addition, a moderating variable such as gender, income, frequency of investment, etc., might be put into the model to see if moderated media-tion is possible. Fifth, the study has been conducted with a sample size of 473 respond-ents. Although the sample size is appropriate, a larger sample size should be employed for future studies that reflect the more realistic scenario of the Indian crypto market.

The study also looks at how FOMO plays a mediating role between herding, loss aversion, overcon-fidence, and crypto investment decisions. To acquire data from crypto retail investors, the study used a questionnaire survey. A total of 473 responses were gathered and analyzed with SmartPLS. To achieve the study’s aims, factor analysis and partial least square struc-tural equation modelling were used. The study’s findings found that FOMO, herding, loss aversion, and overconfidence biases have a substantial effect on the investment decisions of crypto investors, in respective order. In addition, FOMO bias establishes a complemen-tary partial mediation on the relationship between herding, loss aversion, and crypto inves-tors’ decision-making behavior. Ergo, the present study assisted individual and institutional cryptocurrency investors, crypto portfolio managers, policymakers, researchers, and mar -ket regulators in broadening their knowledge base about cryptocurrency and forecasting investors’ behavior. Hence, this study contributes to the field of behavioral finance.Keywords Herding · Loss aversion · Overconfidence · Fear of missing out (FOMO) · Crypto investment decisions * Kirti Sood  kirtisood.phd@doonuniversity.ac.in Manpreet Kaur  manpreetnaunidh@gmail.com Jinesh Jain  jineshjain81@gmail.com1 Sri Aurobindo College of Commerce and Management, Ludhiana, India2 School of Management, Doon University, Dehradun, India
	2238 M. Kaur et al.1 31 IntroductionThe unprecedented expansion of investment alternatives in the financial market has hith-erto empowered the global economy on a large scale. Moving from simple stock or bond investments in the early 1900s to more complex financial derivatives instruments devel-oped later in the decades, such as securities options, credit default swaps, futures, collater -alized debt obligations, and so on, has incentivized investors with higher investment yields while introducing greater risk. This expansion has been spurred further due to the emer -gence of blockchain-based cryptocurrency (also known as crypto assets), which has gar -nered a lot of attention in the academic world as well as the business community owing to its rise over the last decade (Zhang and Zhang 2022). Its market’s valuation increased at an astounding rate from USD 1.2 billion in 2013 to USD 2.16 trillion at the end of the finan-cial year 2021–2022 (CoinMarketCap 2022). Primitively, the voyage of cryptocurrency started when Satoshi Nakamoto (an anonymous name) invented the first permissionless decentralized currency, Bitcoin, in 2009. The first commercial transaction using Bitcoin took place on May 22, 2010, when Laszlo Hanyecz paid 10,000 bitcoins (about $25) for two pizzas (Hidajat 2019; Arias-Oliva et al. 2019). However, it gained public prominence in 2011 when Julian Assange, the founder of Wikileaks, decided to accept donations in Bitcoin (Porterfield 2012). Subsequently, other crypto-tokens and altcoins such as Name-coin, Litecoin, Ripple, Dogecoin, and so forth have aggressively propelled themselves into the public eye (Sun et al. 2021). Numerous recent studies (e.g., Savelyev 2018; Abubakar et al. 2019; Mikhaylov 2020; Mosteanu and Faccia 2020; Delfabbro et al. 2021) have dem-onstrated that cryptocurrencies have cemented their place in today’s digital world and will undoubtedly play a significant role in practically every investor’s portfolio in the years to come.However, cryptocurrency is a more volatile investment vehicle (Sun et al. 2021) com-pared to conventional asset classes of the stock market like commodities, stocks, and bonds (Subramaniam and Chakraborty 2020), and it is not backed by any government or com-modity (Sood and Singh 2022). Corollary, the fundamental analysis of cryptocurrency investments for return predictability fails (Rubbaniy et al. 2022), whilst non-fundamental approaches such as herding (Gurdgiev and Corbet 2018; Bouri et  al. 2019; Kaiser and Stöckl 2020; Vidal-Tomás et al. 2019; Yarovaya et al. 2021), loss aversion (Popova 2019; Haryanto et al. 2020), and overconfidence (Sudzina et al. 2021; Kim and Hanna 2021; Jalal and Leonelli 2021; Nurbarani and Soepriyanto 2022) emerged as the most prevalent driv -ers in the cryptocurrency market, which makes it more challenging to go through tough periods of downturns and dips. Despite this, the cryptocurrency market is seeing positive momentum day by day. The worldwide crypto market capitalization has surpassed $1.20 trillion, owing to high and consistent trade volumes (Maheshwari 2023). This growing rate of the cryptocurrency market is prompting many new investors to invest in cryptocur -rency, which makes many investors apprehensive that they will lose a good return by not investing in it (Sood et al. 2023a, b). As a result, researchers have observed that the "fear of missing out" (FOMO) approach also has a substantial influence on crypto investors’ investment decisions, along with other biases (e.g., Gupta and Shrivastava 2021). Notwith-standing the significant influence of FOMO on cryptocurrency investors’ investment deci-sions, researchers have failed to examine empirically how various biases in the presence of FOMO affect investors’ decisions to invest more in cryptocurrency.Accordingly, this is the first study that, to the best of the researchers’ knowledge, that has examined how FOMO affects the herding, loss aversion, overconfidence, and overall
	 
	2239“All are investing in Crypto, I fear of being missed out”: examining…1 3decision-making of crypto retail investors with the help of the following research questions (RQs): first, do herding, loss aversion, overconfidence, and FOMO biases have a significant impact on crypto retail investors’ decision-making? Second, does FOMO play a mediating role between herding, loss aversion, and overconfidence biases and crypto investors’ deci-sion-making behavior? Ergo, the purpose of this study is to better understand how herding, loss aversion, overconfidence, and FOMO affect cryptocurrency investment decisions. It also attempts to provide a clear picture of whether FOMO mediates these relationships and, if so, whether it does so partially or fully. Thus, the present study assisted individ-ual and institutional cryptocurrency investors, crypto portfolio managers, policymakers, researchers, and market regulators in broadening their knowledge base about cryptocur -rency and forecasting investors’ behavior. This study also helps the Indian government to make strong policy announcements that allow the cryptocurrency industry to operate in a regulated environment. This would not only increase transparency but also help to detect and limit the exploitation of cryptocurrency via money laundering and other criminal acts. This paves the way for the favourable development of the cryptocurrency market. Hence, this study contributes to the field of behavioral finance.The following are the remaining sections: in the section  2, extant literature has been reviewed along with the formulation of hypothesised relationships. The section 3 entails research methodology to examine the hypotheses and validate the extended model. The section  4 of the paper includes data analysis and interpretation. The sections 5 and 6 describe the discussions and implications. The penultimate section covers conclusions, limitations, and scope for future research.2  Conceptual framework and hypotheses developmentTraditional financial markets hold assumptions, such as the unpredictability of returns (Thies and Molnár 2018) and the risk-return trade-off (Aalborg et al. 2019), for cryptocur -rency, such as Bitcoin, whose returns exhibit statistically significant variances in the risk-return trade-off due to anomalous price volatility regimes (Koutmos and Payne 2021). It increases risks, reduces the stability and robustness of hedging features in this asset class, and introduces behavioral biases into the investment decision-making process of crypto-currency (Hairudin et al. 2020; Mokni et al. 2022), which contribute to market anomalies in the crypto market such as bubbles and crashes (Singh et al. 2021). There are four phases of cryptocurrency bubbles: the stealth, awareness, mania, and blowoff phases (Hoang and Mørken 2018). Some of the behavioral biases thought to be present at each stage of the bubble include herding (stealth phase), optimism (awareness phase), overconfidence (mania phase), and loss aversion (blow-off phase) (Hidajat 2019).This signifies that among the several potential predictors of volatility, a dearth of ration-ality in investment decisions cannot be ruled out as a result of behavioral biases (Cheah and Fry 2015). Hence, this study provides an overview of the relevant literature on distinct behavioral biases that impact individual investors’ decision-making behavior in the crypto market in this section. To justify this phenomenon, the present study used the prospect theory (Kahneman and Tversky 1979), which focuses on investors’ decisions based on risk prospects; the heuristics theory (Tversky and Kahneman 1974), which leads to investors making decisions under uncertainty; and the herding theory (Graham 1999), which empha-sizes that investors rely on another investor’s decision more than their own, from the lit-erature of behavioral finance (Dar and Hakeem 2015). Ergo, the present study takes into 
	2240 M. Kaur et al.1 3consideration herding, loss aversion, and overconfidence as independent variables from the pertinent literature of crypto investors since these are the most prominent biases that are found among crypto investors (e.g., Singh et al. 2017; Gupta and Shrivastava 2021; Chhat-wani and Parija 2023), while crypto investors’ decision-making behavior is an independent variable. However, the primary emphasis of this research is to explore FOMO as a media-tor in the relationship between the herding effect, loss aversion, and overconfidence and crypto investors’ decision-making behavior, as depicted in Fig. 1.2.1  Herding and crypto investment decisionsThe term "herding" was originally studied in zoology and, subsequently, psychology (Har -yanto et al. 2020). Herding is a process in which one economic agent imitates the decisions of others instead of acting independently (Baddeley 2010), which results in the synchro-nization of price co-movements of related financial assets (Caferra 2020). According to Christie and Huang (1995), when opinions converge, result variability decreases because beliefs converge to the prevalent market reaction. This tendency has historically devel-oped during times of financial turbulence, such as the 2008 financial crisis, emphasizing the need to research how the herd instinct affects asset values in financial markets (Hälli 2022). This effect has been proven to be the most ubiquitous behavioral bias in the finan-cial market (Kumar and Goyal 2015) in both advanced (Hwang and Salmon 2004) and emerging economies (Agarwal et al. 2011). Women are more prone to the herding effect than men (Katper et al. 2019; Akhtar and Das 2019). Numerous studies (e.g., Vidal-Tomás et al. 2019; Bouri et al. 2019; Gurdgiev and Loughlin 2020; Rubbaniy et al. 2022; Nur -barani and Soepriyanto 2022) have confirmed the significant impact of herding on crypto investors. Poyser (2018) investigated herding behavioral under symmetric and asymmetric conditions, claiming that herding drives cryptocurrency values. According to Ballis and Drakos (2020), herding was shown to be more pronounced in a bullish market. In contrast, da Gama et al. (2019) found that when the market is bearish, there is a herding effect. How -ever, Haryanto et al. (2020) observed that herding follows the market trend. When the bit-coin price rises, herding becomes more prevalent in both bullish and bearish periods. Thus, the first hypothesis of the study is:Fig. 1  Conceptual model. Source: Authors’ Compilation
	2241“All are investing in Crypto, I fear of being missed out”: examining…1 3H1 Herding has a significant influence on crypto investment decisions.2.2  Loss aversion and crypto investment decisionsInvestors are often more apprehensive about any losses they may experience as the decisions they make regarding their investments have an impact on their family’s finan-cial condition. In prospect theory, this is known as loss aversion (Barberis et al. 2003). Shefrin and Statman (1985) were the first to describe this phenomenon, claiming that most people seek to sell financial assets that have recently acquired a stronger position than those that are in a weaker position. In other words, investors prefer to sell winning assets in order to maximize gains in the probability that prices fall in the future (Dar and Hakeem 2015) because they hate losses and prefer to conserve capital rather than focus on increasing it (Jain et al. 2021). Male investors are less risk-averse than female inves-tors (Hassan et al. 2014; Gonzalez-Igual et al. 2018). Prior studies (e.g., Popova 2019; Haryanto et al. 2020) have demonstrated that individual investors’ investment decisions in the crypto market are influenced by loss aversion bias, which can manifest itself dur -ing the blow-off phase when investors who have lost money due to price drops continue to hold Bitcoin because they think that they will suffer greatly if they sell it at a loss (Hidajat 2019). Loss aversion causes disposition effects, in which investors continue to lose capital to avoid getting upset (Rau 2014). The negative disposition effect occurs when bitcoin prices have been rising (during bullish times), but the positive disposition effect occurs when bitcoin prices have been falling (during bearish periods) (Haryanto et al. 2020). Thus, the second hypothesis of the study is:H2 Loss aversion has a significant influence on crypto investment decisions.2.3  Overconfidence and crypto investment decisionsOverconfidence is a phenomenon that occurs when individuals believe they know more than others (Pompian 2006). They consider their judgement superior to others’ (Jain et al. 2015) and feel that they know more than they can do (Shiller 2000). Overconfi-dence is often related to numerous words in the economic literature, like "better-than-average effect," “illusion of control," "miscalibration," and "unrealistic optimism" (Glaser and Weber 2007). People demonstrate overconfidence in their knowledge, com-petence, and skills while investing in the financial market, which is inextricably linked with optimism (Poyser 2018). Many investors are optimistic regarding their knowledge of investments and overlook the risks involved (Jain et al. 2021). Women are less con-fident in their investment decisions than men due to a lot of societal pressure (Pulford and Colman 1997; Hira and Loibl 2008). When the price of Bitcoin reaches an all-time high during the mania phase, investors think they have superior knowledge and capac-ity to discern which cryptocurrencies to invest in (Hidajat 2019). As a result, they are more likely to invest in cryptocurrency (Jalal and Leonelli 2021; Kim and Hanna 2021; Sudzina et al. 2021; Nurbarani and Soepriyanto 2022). Thus, the third hypothesis of the study is:H3 Overconfidence has a significant influence on crypto investment decisions.
	2242 M. Kaur et al.1 32.4  FOMO and crypto investment decisionsThe term "fear of missing out" (FOMO) was coined in 2004 to characterize a behav -ior identified on social networking sites (Gupta and Sharma 2021), where it is associ-ated with the dread and anxiousness of missing out on crucial information and break -throughs due to not being constantly connected to social media (Przybylski et al. 2013). In the context of investment decisions, FOMO bias arises when investors notice that other investors are entering the market or targeting specific financial instruments, as they believe they should do the same or risk missing out on the opportunity (Hersh-field 2020a, b). They are prompted by a desire to increase their earnings; therefore, they attempt not to miss out on any chance to make prospective gains (Kang et al. 2020). Hysteria erupted in the market when cryptocurrencies were unveiled, with everyone wanting to invest in these digital currencies (Denison et  al. 2019). It was also found that many investors didn’t have much idea about cryptocurrency, but fear of missing out caused them to invest in it blindly (Gupta and Shrivastava 2021). Ergo, FOMO does affect investing decisions, whether deliberately or unwittingly (Martin et  al. 2022). There have been a few studies (e.g., Baur and Dimpfl 2018; Delfabbro et al. 2021; Zhang and Mani 2021; Martin et  al. 2022; Bonaparte 2022) that discussed FOMO in cryp-tocurrency investment decisions. According to Zhang and Mani (2021), positive mar -ket shocks have a bigger influence on the volatility of these financial assets than nega-tive shocks of equal magnitude due to the FOMO effect. Some studies have shown that women experience more FOMO than men (Stead and Bibby 2017; Beyens et al. 2016), although Przybylski et al. (2013) discovered the contrary. Thus, the fourth hypothesis of the study is:H4 FOMO has a significant influence on crypto investment decisions.2.5  FOMO as mediatorFOMO’s relationship with herding, loss aversion, and overconfidence in various contexts has been validated by several studies in the past (e.g., Kang et al. 2020; Tarjanne 2020; Gupta and Shrivastava 2021). The authors of these studies stated that FOMO drives people to collectively consume products in order to get psychological consolation. Many individu-als are more inclined to invest in investment instruments when they notice that their friends and colleagues are thriving in the financial market. As a consequence, FOMO predomi-nates, which causes herd behavior and constantly drives financial asset prices up (Hersh-field 2020a, b). Denison et  al. (2019) identified FOMO as a strong driver to encourage investors to make quick investment decisions in order to keep up with their neighbors and colleagues. The author also highlighted that many investors are overly impulsive in order to get high returns immediately and avoid future losses. The presence of FOMO considerably amplifies the effect of loss aversion and herding on investors’ investment decisions. This indicates that while individual investors may normally demonstrate some extent of herding effect or loss aversion while taking investment decisions, if they are predisposed to FOMO, their investment decisions will be considerably more influenced by herd behavior or loss aversion (Gupta and Shrivastava 2021). In the context of overconfidence bias, Liu (2019a, b) discovered that less confident investors are more susceptible to the FOMO effect, since people lack confidence when they are unsure of whether they should invest in a particular financial asset or not, but due to the FOMO effect, they are willing to do so. On the other side, when an investor is more confident about their investment, they continue it with the 
	2243“All are investing in Crypto, I fear of being missed out”: examining…1 3expectation that they will undoubtedly receive a high return. Thus, the projected hypoth-eses of the study are:H5 Herding has a significant influence on FOMO in crypto investment decisions.H6 Loss aversion has a significant influence on FOMO in crypto investment decisions.H7 Overconfidence has a significant influence on FOMO in crypto investment decisions.H8 FOMO among cryptocurrency investors mediates the relationship between herding and crypto investment decisions.H9 FOMO among cryptocurrency investors mediates the relationship between loss aver -sion and crypto investment decisions.H10 FOMO among cryptocurrency retail investors does not mediate the relationship between overconfidence and crypto investment decisions.3  Research methodology3.1  Evaluation frameworkThe current study was intently interested in examining the effect of behavioral biases on investment decisions of those crypto investors who have a minimum of 2 years of invest-ment experience in crypto market, as experienced investors make sound investment deci-sions based on value criteria (Korniotis and Kumar 2011) and their investment techniques may undergo significant change (Tripathi 2008). A measurement scale for the present study was devised after an extensive analysis of the pertinent literature, in which various con-structs and their corresponding items were chosen. To confirm the validity of various latent constructs and their items and to certify that the dimensions of the constructs are suitably worded and understandable, the present study deployed pre-testing methods, such as semi-structured interviews of two academic experts, one financial expert, and five experienced crypto investors. Their suggestions and opinions were considered to the greatest extent possible without affecting the nature of the questions. Thenceforth, data was collected from the respondents using a 7-point Likert scale with the options of "strongly disagree" to "strongly agree."3.2  Designing of questionnaireTo collect primary data from crypto investors, a structured questionnaire was used. The questionnaire used in the study was labelled, "The objective of this survey is to collect tangible information about how behavioral biases impact crypto investors’ investment deci-sions." The questionnaire was divided into two sections. Section I included 8 questions related to the demographic information of the respondents, such as gender, age, education, occupation, annual income, investment experience, percentage of income invested, and fre-quency of investment. Section II incorporated 24 items related to various constructs of the study, namely, herding, loss aversion, overconfidence, FOMO, and cryptocurrency invest-ment decisions, extracted from relevant literature, i.e., Gupta and Shrivastava (2021), Jain et al. (2021), Liu (2019a, b); and Luong and Thu Ha (2011) (see “ Appendix”). However, in accordance with the study’s aims and focus, the scale was later amended in accordance with the guidelines given by Netemeyer et al. (2003).
	2244 M. Kaur et al.1 33.3  Data collectionCrypto investment in India is mostly driven by the Generation Z and millennial popula-tions. According to the report of homegrown crypto exchange CoinSwitch, the vast major -ity of crypto investors in the nation are between the ages of 18–25 and 26–35 (CoinSwitch 2022). Therefore, the present study’s population included crypto retail investors from the north Indian region, namely Jammu and Kashmir, Delhi NCR, Himachal Pradesh, Hary -ana, Punjab, Uttarakhand, and Chandigarh, due to its diverse culture and more young pop-ulation (see Singh et al. 2017; Kaur et al. 2021). In addition, Bhaskar (2016) reported that the North Indian consumers are rich and tech savvy who easily adapt online services. Even north Indian females use more digital technology as compared to other regions (Tech2 2016). A snowball sampling technique was deployed to collect primary data. Snowball sampling is a non-probability sampling technique that is best suited for those research stud-ies where a specific type of population is required but it is difficult to access and there is an interconnected network of people or organizations (Sood et al. 2022; Nardi 2006). In the present study, the population was of a specific type, i.e., crypto investors, and they belonged to an interconnected system of crypto exchanges. Two qualifying questions were asked at the outset of the survey: (1) Are you aware of cryptocurrency? (2) Do you have at least 2 years of experience in cryptocurrency investment? Those who responded "yes" were given access to the whole questionnaire. A total of 689 individual crypto investors of dif-ferent ages, geographies, and investment corpuses were solicited physically and electroni-cally (via email, WhatsApp, and Telegram) during a four-month period, from July 2022 to October 2022. In addition, several personal and telephone interviews were carried out to help respondents better comprehend the concepts and questions by taking time from them at their convenience. Regular reminders were also sent out to ensure that the data was collected on time. A total of 541 crypto investors responded positively to the ques-tionnaire, out of which 68 were found to be incomplete or invalid. Therefore, it has been removed from the final analysis. The remaining 473 responses are considered for final anal-ysis, resulting in a response rate of 68.65% (as shown in Table  1). It has been documented that the Cochran (1963) formula was used to calculate sample size, which is acceptable when the population is large or infinite (Israel 1992). Further, to confirm the appropriate-ness of the sample size, G*Power (Faul et al. 2009) was used, which indicated 125 as the minimum sample required to attain statistical power of 99%. Similar researchers in the past (e.g., Sharma et al. 2022) have also conducted their study in the crypto domain with an approximate similar sample size.3.4  Participants descriptionMale investors composed 79.7% of the 467 respondents, while female investors accounted for the remaining 20.3%. Furthermore, the majority of investors, 43.3%, were found to be between the ages of 30–40. This reveals that the crypto investment market is dominated by young and male investors, which is consistent with Steinmetz et al. (2021)’s and Auer and Tercero-Lucas (2022)’s  findings, who reported that the majority of crypto investors are young and male. In addition, 49% of respondents were postgraduates, while 36.6% were graduates. Further -more, 49.2% of respondents were self-employed, while 33% were salaried. In terms of annual income, 35.3% of respondents earn between 10 to 15 lakhs, while 26% earn between 5 to10 lakhs. This suggests that highly qualified investors with good earnings are more likely to invest in cryptocurrencies. When it comes to investment experience, 85.6% of investors have 2 to 
	2245“All are investing in Crypto, I fear of being missed out”: examining…1 35 years of experience. This implies that the subjects of research are experienced in the crypto market. This ensured more consistent outcomes, as experience has a positive influence on investment skills (Korniotis and Kumar 2011). Additionally, 52% of respondents reported that they are investing approximately 10% to 20% of their incomes in the crypto market. Another intriguing conclusion was that the majority of investors, i.e., 58.3%, invest in cryptocurren-cies on a monthly basis. This shows that the preponderance of investors in the cryptocurrency market are active investors.

	2246 M. Kaur et al.1 34  Data analysis and interpretation4.1  Common method biasWhile carrying out behavioral studies, when data for both endogenous and exogenous constructs is collected through a single instrument, it is a must to check the presence of common method bias (CMB) problem (Kock 2015). In the present study, CMB was meas-ured using a Harman single factor, in which all the items of endogenous and exogenous constructs were loaded into a single factor using exploratory factor analysis, which takes into account variances of less than 50% (Streukens et al. 2017). Using unrotated principal component analysis, it was found that a single factor made up of all the items explained 41.938% of the variance in the current study. This shows that there is no CMB.4.2  Measurement model assessmentThe measurement model of the present research has five latent constructs: herding, loss aversion, overconfidence, FOMO, and investment decisions (as shown in Fig.  2). In the measurement model, reliability and validity of exogenous and endogenous variables were assessed using SmartPLS (version 4.0.8.7), which includes indicator reliability, construct reliability, convergent validity, and discriminant validity. Indicator reliability is acquired by squaring the outer loadings of reflective constructs, which describe the relationship between the latent variables and their measurements (Ringle et al. 2015). When the outer loadings of all items are above the threshold value of 0.708 (Hair et al. 2016), indicator reliability is assured, as shown in Table  2. To test construct reliability, composite reliabil-ity, and Cronbach’s alpha were determined; the values of both should be in the range of 0.7 and 0.95 (Diamantopoulos et al. 2012). This was assured in the current study since the Cronbach’s alpha and composite reliability values were both within the prescribed range.

This was confirmed by the fact that the AVE of all constructs was greater than 0.5, as shown in Table 2.Further, the discriminant validity of the model was analysed using two criteria (Table  3). The first criteria is to check the heterotrait-monotrait (HTMT) criterion, which should be less than 0.85 for all constructs (Henseler et al. 2016), displayed in Table  3, which confirms the discriminant validity of the constructs. Another criterion suggested by Fornell and Larcker (1981) was also used to assess discriminant validity. In this method, correlation among constructs should be less than the square root of AVE for every construct (Ringle et al. 2015), which was achieved as shown in Table 4.4.3  Structural model assessmentBefore testing a hypothesis, the first step in evaluating a structural model is to look at issues of multicollinearity. Diamantopoulos and Siguaw (2006) stated that high intercor -relation between variables is the main cause of multicollinearity in any model. Variance inflation factor (VIF) is the standard approach for determining if a model has multicol-linearity issues (Diamantopoulos and Siguaw 2006). The values of VIF must be less than 5, which is a reliable indicator of the truancy of multicollinearity issues in a model (Hair et al. 2017). In this study, all of the VIF values for the predictor variables were less than 5, which shows that there were no issues of multicollinearity in the inner model. The sec-ond step is to put the study’s hypotheses to the test through the bootstrapping technique in SmartPLS. Bootstrapping is a resampling technique performed with a subsample size of 5,000 since a large sample size assures reduced variance between the original and mean values of regression path coefficients. Besides, it helps in ensuring the stability of estimates (Davcik 2014). Ergo, it generated path coefficients, p values, and t-statistics, which are dis-played in Table 5.Table 3  HTMT criterion.

	2250 M. Kaur et al.1 3The structural model of the research is displayed in Fig.  3. The study’s results showed that all four behavior biases—herding (HD), loss aversion (LA), overconfidence (OC), and fear of missing out (FOMO)—have a positive and significant effect on crypto investment decisions (CID), which supports H1, H2, H3, and H4 (as shown in Table  5). In this context, FOMO (b = 0.298, t = 6.322) has the greatest influence on crypto investment decisions among the four biases, followed by HD (b = 0.246, t = 4.575), LA (b = 0.196, t = 4.26), and OC (b = 0.189, t = 3.726). As far as H5, H6, and H7 are concerned, full statistical support was found for all of them, which stated that all three behavioral biases, i.e., HD, LA, and OC, were found to have a significant positive impact on FOMO. Out of them, LA (b = 0.486, t = 12.721) has the most substantial influence of FOMO, followed by HD (b = 0.257, t = 6.022) and OC (b = 0.124, t = 3.262). To ana-lyze the mediating effect of FOMO on the relationship between behavior biases, namely, herding, loss aversion, and overconfidence bias, and crypto investment decisions, Nitzl Table 5  Path analysis.

(2017) guidelines were followed in the present study.The indirect effects of HD (b = 0.077), LA (b = 0.145), and OC (b = 0.037) were found to be significant, as shown in Table  5. The total effect of HD on CID was also significant, with b = 0.323 and t = 6.006. Similarly, the total effect of OC (b = 0.226, t = 4.468) and LA (b = 0.341, t = 7.167) on CID was also found to be significant. The strength of the mediation as per guidelines given by Nitzl et al. (2016) was analyzed, and Variance Accounted For (VAF) values (shown in Table  5) were also calculated by dividing indirect effect by total effect for every relationship. If VAF is less than 20%, nearly zero mediation occurs; if VAF is greater than 20% but less than 80%, it could be characterized as a typical partial mediation; and a VAF above 80% indicates a full mediation (Nitzl et al. 2016). Hence, in the present research, VAF values conclude par -tial mediation in the case of LA and HD, whereas FOMO was not found to be mediating the relationship between OC and CID as the VAF value is less than 20%. The signs of direct and indirect effects for both HD and LA are positive. As a result, a complemen-tary partial mediation of FOMO bias on the relationship between HD, LA and CID has been established.When the impact of LA, HD, and OC on CID was checked without using FOMO as a mediator, R2 was found to be 43%. The addition of FOMO as a mediator to the model increased R2 to 0.479, indicating that 48% of the variance in CID is explained by HD, LA, OC, and FOMO, indicating good predictive precision of the model (Hair et al. 2019). Further  Q2 and PLS predict were analyzed to assess the predictive relevance of the model as per the guidelines given by Shmueli et al. (2019), and the results are shown in Table  6.  Q2 predict values for the PLS model are greater than 0 for all items of CID, the endogenous construct. PLS RMSE values should be compared with LM RMSE values if PLS MV prediction errors of endogenous constructs are symmetric; otherwise, PLS MAE values should be compared with LM MAE values to check the predictive relevance of the model (Shmueli et al. 2019). PLS MV prediction errors (as shown in Fig.  4) were analysed for all indicators of CID and found to be non-symmetric by obser -vation. Hence, PLS MAE values were compared with LM MAE values for all indicators of CID. The results are displayed in Table  6. If PLS values are greater than LM values for all the indicators, then the model shows high predictive power, whereas if it happens for half or more than half of all indicators, medium predictive power is proved (Shmueli et al. 2019). For half of the indicators, PLS MAE values were smaller than LM MAE values, signifying medium predictive relevance of the model (Shmueli et al. 2019).Table 6  Results of PLS predict.

	2252 M. Kaur et al.1 34.4  Robustness checkTo check the robustness of the specified model, the guidelines mentioned by Sarstedt et al. (2020) were followed. Results of any research are considered robust if non-linearity and endogeneity are not present in the model. Thus, firstly, potential nonlinearities were checked in the structural model relationships. The quadratic effects of HD, OC, and LA on CID, as well as FOMO and the effects of FOMO on CID, were represented by interaction terms. Bootstrapping was run with 5000 subsamples. The interaction effects of all exog-enous constructs, i.e., HD (p value = 0.420), OC (p value = 0.100), and LA (p value = 0.27) on FOMO were found to be insignificant. Similarly, the interaction effects of all exogenous constructs on CID were found to be insignificant, including HD (p value = 0.128), OC (p value = 0.63), LA (p value = 0.15), and FOMO (p value = 0.821). Non-linear relationships were not found in the model because the quadratic effects for all constructs were insignifi-cant. Secondly, the model was checked for endogeneity. For this Park and Gupta’s (2012), Gaussian Coupla approach was used. All combinations of Gaussian copulas included in the model were checked, and none were found to be significant (as shown in Table  7). Hence, Fig. 4  PLS MV prediction errors for indicators of Crypto investment decisions
	2253“All are investing in Crypto, I fear of being missed out”: examining…1 3it can be concluded that endogeneity is not present in this study, which supports the robust-ness of the structural model results of the present research (Hult et al. 2018). Ergo, robust-ness was ensured in terms of nonlinear effects and endogeneity.5  DiscussionsThe study has undertaken the effort to examine how herding, loss aversion, overconfidence, and FOMO affect the investment choices made by cryptocurrency investors. Although there is a dearth of primary research on the behavior biases that influence the investment choices of crypto investors, this study goes a step further by conducting a field survey and analyzing the mediating effect of FOMO in the relationship between herding, loss aversion, overconfidence, and the decision-making behavior of crypto investors. The current study’s findings show that all four variables have a considerable effect, with FOMO having the strongest influence on the investment decisions of crypto investors, followed by herding, loss aversion, and overconfidence, respectively. In the context of FOMO, respondents of the study have opined that when they see other investors entering the cryptocurrency mar -ket, it makes them feel pushed to do the same so as not to miss out on the lucrative returns that others are obtaining. This tendency leads individuals to invest without thinking criti-cally, and they occasionally drown. This finding is consistent with previous research stud-ies (e.g., Baur and Dimpfl 2018; Delfabbro et al. 2021; Zhang and Mani 2021; Bonaparte 2022; Martin et al. 2022).The study outcome has also stated that herding is rapidly growing in the cryptocurrency market as a result of market stress, significant price volatility, a lack of quality information, and cryptocurrency investors’ expectations of unprecedented positive returns. This suggests that cryptocurrency investors do not make investment decisions in isolation. Instead, they discuss cryptocurrency investment with folks that have the most influence on their think -ing process and are easily influenced by them. Many investors believe that if the majority of investors’ decisions are sound, they will experience substantial returns and avoid losses; therefore, they base their investment decisions on how other investors choose to hold their Table 7  Assessment of endogeneity test using the Gaussian copula approachTest Construct Coefficient p valueGaussian copula of model 1 (HD) HD 0.073 0.833Gaussian copula of model 2 (OC) OC − 0.281 0.159Gaussian copula of model 3 (LA) LA 0.212 0.245Gaussian copula of model 4 (FOMO) FOMO 0.022 0.89Gaussian copula of model 5 (HD and OC) HD 0.116 0.738OC − 0.289 0.155Gaussian copula of model 6 (OC and LA) OC − 0.297 0.141LA 0.223 0.219Gaussian copula of model 7 (LA and FOMO) LA 0.219 0.226FOMO 0.058 0.71Gaussian copula of model 8 (FOMO and HD) FOMO 0.018 0.914HD 0.069 0.846Gaussian copula of model 9 (HD, OC and LA) HD 0.093 0.794

This finding is consistent with previous research studies (e.g., Vidal-Tomás et al. 2019; Bouri et al. 2019; Gurdgiev and Loughlin 2020; Rubbaniy et al. 2022; Nurbarani and Soepriyanto 2022). Moreover, respondents of the study have opinion-ated that whenever they get a chance to earn a potential gain, they become risk averse due to cryptocurrency market volatility and book the profit. On the other hand, they recognise that whenever they face losses, they are putting themselves at unnecessary risk. In short, they are generally more inclined toward avoiding losses than earning profits. As a result of their hasty decisions in the cryptocurrency market in order to minimise losses, investors suffer massive losses. This finding is consistent with Popova (2019) and Haryanto et al. (2020).Additionally, the study’s results have indicated that cryptocurrency investors are also overconfident in their investment decisions. Overconfidence is unquestionably connected to risky crypto investments, and overconfident individuals are lured into high-risk endeavours since they think that they know when to enter or exit the crypto market. Besides, they are overly optimistic about their skills in a certain scenario. However, overconfident investors do not prepare for any type of uncertainty, which puts them at risk of large losses some-times (Jain et  al. 2021). Various research studies (e.g., Kim and Hanna 2021; Jalal and Leonelli 2021; Sudzina et al. 2021; Nurbarani and Soepriyanto 2022) are consistent with this finding of the present study. Additionally, the present study has a substantial focus on the mediating effect of FOMO bias on the relationship between herding, loss aversion, overconfidence, and crypto investment decisions. In this regard, the findings of the research indicated that herding, loss aversion, and overconfidence play a substantial role in crypto investment decisions even in the absence of FOMO. However, because of the presence of FOMO bias, the impact of herding and loss aversion biases on crypto investment decisions has been greatly amplified, while the impact of overconfidence has not. The reasoning behind this finding is that because FOMO causes market deception, one should invest in cryptocurrencies; otherwise, they will miss out on earning a return. As a result, individuals are beginning to follow other people more and act on their recommendations. Furthermore, due to FOMO bias, many crypto investors become extremely aggressive in order to gain large profits quickly and prevent future losses. Overconfident crypto investors, on the other hand, are sure that they will do better than where they invest, so they don’t worry about missing any opportunities.6  Implications6.1  Theoretical implicationsOver the past many years, behavioral finance has led to a better understanding of actual investor behavior and real-world market practices, and it is likely to make substantial future developments (Delfabbro et al. 2021). Consequently, the study broadens theoretical contri-butions in the realm of behavioral finance and related theories, such as prospect, heuristic, and herding, by extending an understanding of how investors behave while investing in the cryptocurrency market with the additional element of FOMO. Herding, loss aversion, and overconfidence biases cause behavioral anomalies in the crypto market since investors rely on collective information and neglect real facts when making investments. Ergo, a better understanding of these critical biases and investors’ behavior due to the presence of FOMO bias fills a gap in the present research. Furthermore, the current study adds new insights to 
	2255“All are investing in Crypto, I fear of being missed out”: examining…1 3traditional quantitative models such as the modern portfolio theory (MPT), efficient market theory (EMT), arbitrage pricing theory (APT), and capital asset pricing model (CAPM), which assume that individual investors make perfectly rational decisions. However, in the real world, no perfect rationality exists no matter how much experience an investor has, since rationality is limited when an individual makes investment decisions due to cogni-tive limitations such as limitations of knowledge, resources, computational capacity, and time constraints, as well as the emotional biases of the decision-makers, which are tricky to control or change, especially during market turbulence (Pompain 2012). Thus, this research encourages all types of cryptocurrency investors and financial experts to recognize that understanding behavioral finance concepts and theories is critical for understanding the decision-making behavior of crypto investors.6.2  Practical implicationsThis study has practical implications for individual and institutional cryptocurrency inves-tors, crypto portfolio managers, policymakers, researchers, market regulators, and society at large. First, the findings of the present study enable investors to comprehend how their own psychological factors influence their choice of investments. Hence, when selecting investment avenues, cryptocurrency investors should take into consideration the influ-ence of critical biases such as herding, loss aversion, overconfidence, and FOMO. This can increase their understanding of the possible financial pitfalls of cryptocurrency caused by behavior biases, which would aid in achieving an optimal return on investment and avoid-ing any potential errors in judgment. Second, this study helps crypto portfolio managers who keep an eye on bitcoin and many altcoins figure out which behavior biases affect cryp-tocurrency investors the most. This lets them give their clients the best investment advice. Third, this research provides policymakers with valuable information and expertise on the behavioral aspects of individual investors, helping them to make the best decisions and methods for crypto investors to enhance cryptocurrency investment among Indian inves-tors. Policymakers would be better equipped to judge the necessity of cryptocurrency regu-lations if they understood how investors make decisions. Fourth, the study is useful for both researchers and academicians because it helps them to understand them how distinct psychology of cryptocurrency investor. Fifth, this research helps the market regulators to make stronger laws and regulations that are required to limit the influence of behav -ior biases on crypto investors’ decision-making and offer investors a more secure invest-ing environment. These laws ultimately help the Indian government with the enactment of comprehensive policy announcements that allow the cryptocurrency industry to operate in a regulated environment (Tambe and Jain 2023). In this regard, the Finance Ministry has taken a comprehensive step by including cryptocurrency under the ambit of the “Pre-vention of Money Laundering Act” (PMLA) (Chadha 2023). This implies that custodians, exchanges, and wallet providers, among others, engaged in crypto-related trade will be sub-ject to the PMLA (Chadha 2023). Due to this law, crypto companies will now be required to carry out their operations with more due diligence, which can help keep the crypto mar -ket stable and lower the risk for investors in cryptocurrencies in the long run. This would not only increase transparency but also help to detect and limit the exploitation of crypto-currency via money laundering and other criminal acts. This paves the way for the favour -able development of the cryptocurrency market. It may help stop people from speculating on cryptocurrency, which would control behavioral biases and make cryptocurrency a good way to invest that adds to the gross domestic product (GDP) and helps society

	2256 M. Kaur et al.1 37  Conclusion, limitations, and scope for future researchSince the RBI lifted its ban on investing in cryptocurrencies in March 2020, there has been a huge increase in them. Indian exchanges have seen a lot of new users join, and their daily trading volumes keep going up (Saundal 2021). Even though investing in cryptocurrencies has gone through the roof, it is very risky and has a high risk-to-reward ratio (Fonseca et  al. 2019). One of the main reasons why cryptocurrency prices change a lot is because of how investors’ emotions affect their decisions. In this context, the current study looked at the most significant behavioral factors, like herding, loss aversion, overconfidence, and fear of missing out (FOMO), that affect how cryptocurrency investors choose to invest their money. The study has also looked at how FOMO affects herding, loss aversion, overconfidence, and the decisions peo-ple make about investing in crypto. The results of the study showed that each of the four biases has a big effect on how cryptocurrency investors choose where to put their money. Unexpectedly, FOMO has turned out to be the most influential bias, followed by herding, loss aversion, and overconfidence, in that order. In addition, FOMO bias establishes a complementary partial mediation between herding, loss aversion, over -confidence, and crypto investment decisions. In conclusion, this study has shown that behavioral factors, when combined with other factors, are an important phenomenon that should be studied regularly to understand how crypto investors make decisions, since these factors affect the investors’ portfolios, the market, and the economy as a whole.However, there are certain limitations attached to the present study. First, the data has been collected from those individuals who have invested continuously in crypto-currencies for at least two years; hence, only experienced participants were included in this study. A future study might be conducted on novel investors as well. Second, the study was confined to individual crypto investors in one country, India, and one finan-cial market. Therefore, there is a need to exercise caution when projecting the findings to other regions. Future research might be undertaken in overseas markets with differ -ent populations, such as professional crypto investors. Third, the study’s findings are based on a sample of north Indian crypto investors. As a result, future research may be undertaken using countrywide data. Fourth, the study solely looked at the herding effect, loss aversion, and overconfidence. Other heuristics and prospect biases can be studied in the future to see how they affect cryptocurrency investment decisions in the presence of FOMO bias. In addition, a moderating variable such as gender, income, frequency of investment, etc., might be put into the model to see if moderated media-tion is possible. Fifth, the study has been conducted with a sample size of 473 respond-ents. Although the sample size is appropriate, a larger sample size should be employed for future studies that reflect the more realistic scenario of the Indian crypto market.

	No Limits? Effects of FOMO and Gamification on Individual Investment Behaviour in Neo-broker Stock Trading 2SummaryAccording to behavioural finance, cognitive and emotional biases cause irrational trading behaviour. In our study,we investigate how specific biases interact with two recent, social media related phenomena: Fear of missing out(FOMO) and gamification. This relationship is particularly relevant for users of “neo-broker” apps like Robinhood,which have become very popular with young target groups. There are various studies on FOMO and gamification,however, so far there is no research combining both factors and linking them to irrational investing. The context ofneo-brokers provides a suitable research environment as they are closely embedded in the social-media ecosystem.Our research aims to determine how gamification and FOMO impact neo-broker users’ investment behaviour. Thefindings indicate a significant moderate effect amplifying irrational tendencies among German retail investors.Keywords: Fear of missing out (FOMO), gamification, investment biases, neo-brokers, retail investors© Udo Bomnüter1, Brigitte Kleinselbeck1, Heiko Reusch1, Hendrik Schmidt2 (2023).

	No Limits? Effects of FOMO and Gamification on Individual Investment Behaviour in Neo-broker Stock Trading 3IntroductionA new type of fin-tech companies such as Robinhoodhave achieved an exceptional market performancesince their launch in the mid-2010s. These so-calledneo-brokers offer near commission-free stock tradingon a convenient, seamless mobile app or website(Meyer et al., 2021). Due to their favourable conditionsof use, neo-brokers particularly appeal to youngermarket segments (Oliver, 2021), fuelling a surge inretail trading that has contributed to short-term, erraticspeculations on individual stocks (Coggan, 2021). Twophenomena are held responsible for this trend: Firstly,the increasing appearance of “FOMO buy” calls-to-action on social media. These are postings aimed at thefear of missing out (FOMO) on investmentopportunities if a stock is not purchased immediately(Khan, 2021). Secondly, the integration ofgamification, i.e., typical elements of game playing(Hamari et al., 2014), to incentivise financial decisions(Shrikanth, 2020). Industry experts blame FOMO andgamification for affecting retail investors’ behaviour,causing them to invest less rationally (e.g., Khan,2021).Research in this field is rare yet. While there is a largebody of research on factors influencing agents’ ormanagers’ financial decisions (e.g., Kahnemann &Tversky, 1979; Odean, 1999; Prechter, 2001;Thowfeek et al., 2020), only few studies addressFOMO effects on individual trading (e.g., Elhai et al.,2020; Huber & Hobart, 2019). Academic interest intrading app users’ behaviour is only beginning to form(e.g., Potsaid & Venkataraman, 2022). Likewise, fewstudies have addressed the potential impact ofgamification in contemporary investment environments(e.g., Bayuk & Altobello, 2019; Pal et al., 2021). Onlyvan der Heide & Želinský (2020) critically discusssocietal consequences of gamification in day-tradingapps.Our study is the first to link FOMO and gamificationto investment decisions via social media platforms,particularly among non-professional users of neo-broker apps (NBA). Following an extensive literaturereview, we create a conceptual framework forexplaining irrational trading behaviour of Germanretail investors through media-related effects of FOMOand gamification.For our study, we apply a cross-sectional design of datacollection. Based on an online survey with 735participants, we examine the data set using OLSregression. Perceived FOMO in trading situations andresponse to gamification are defined as explanatoryvariables and types of biases in investment decisions asresponse variables. We also consider trading frequency,trading experience, age, and gender as potentialconfounders. Our findings indicate limited effects onirrational trading behaviour mostly of FOMO, whilehinting at weak moderating influences of tradingexperience and frequency.In the implications part, we discuss how neo-brokersmight use such insights to optimise their valueproposition while considering the introduction ofgovernance mechanisms to prevent negative sideeffects. Beyond practical implications, our findings areintended to contribute to conceptualising theinvestment sector’s current transformation with regardto the interaction between digital platforms and theiraffordances, and psychological factors and processesunderlying actual investment behaviour.Literature ReviewAfter a brief overview of the business model and usercharacteristics of neo-brokers, our review addressesthree strands of literature, i.e., behavioural finance,gamification, and FOMO.Neo-brokersNeo-brokers are a new generation of financialintermediaries. They operate online platformsmediating orders to buy or sell various assets (e.g.,stocks, options, exchange-traded funds, orcryptocurrencies). Instead of executing ordersthemselves, neo-brokers route them to third parties,i.e., market makers, for execution. Between the actualtime of purchase with the corresponding asset priceand the execution of the order, a discrepancy arises, theso-called bid-ask-spread
	. Market makers generaterevenues from this spread, which they share with theneo-brokers. This revenue model is called “payment-for-order-flow” (Frölich & Lembach, 2021; Meyer etal., 2021).Neo-brokers offer near commission-free trading due totheir cost-efficient IT infrastructure, specialisation in alimited number of market makers and stock exchanges,and restricted services. Users can conveniently placeorders via a smartphone trading app or a browser-basedweb trader (Frölich & Lembach, 2021; Meyer et al.,© Udo Bomnüter1, Brigitte Kleinselbeck1, Heiko Reusch1, Hendrik Schmidt2 (2023).

Their favourable terms and conditions and theiruse of gamified features make NBAs particularlyappealing to younger market segments (Oliver, 2021;van der Heide & Želinský, 2020).Two prominent examples are the German neo-brokerTrade Republic, founded in 2013, and the U.S.company Robinhood, founded in 2015. Both are app-focused and offer their services either for a minimalflat fee per order like Trade Republic (2022) or evencommission-free like Robinhood (2022a). As ofDecember 2021, Robinhood registered 17.8 millionactive users in the U.S. (Robinhood, 2022b) comparedto Trade Republic’s more than one million users in sixEuropean countries (Trade Republic, 2022). Accordingto a 2021 survey among German Trade Republic users,almost 70% are younger than 35 years, and 84.3% aremale. More than half have invested in capital marketsfor the first time. On average, novice investors invested37% of their private wealth. Almost 30% belong tohouseholds in the lower half of the income distribution.Regarding their motives, most (72%) stated that theysee their investment as long-term savings, while 34%attached great importance to short-term gains. 20%admitted they primarily enjoy the thrill of investing(Kritikos et al., 2022).Behavioural financeFor long, economic and financial theories centredaround the axioms that investors would act rationallyand consider all relevant information when makinginvestment decisions. (Nagy & Obenberger, 1994;Thowfeek Ahamed et al., 2020). These principles werefirst presented in the neoclassical “Expected UtilityTheory” (EUT) developed by von Neumann andMorgenstern (1944), who postulated that investorswould take financial decisions in a way that maximisesexpected return while minimising risk at the same time– a view, most neoclassical theorists have sharedsubsequently (e.g., Fama, 1970; Markowitz, 1952).“Behavioural finance” as a subdiscipline of behaviouraleconomics contrasts with neoclassical finance. Theterm describes explanatory approaches that investigatepsychological and sociological influences on thedecision-making processes of individuals, groups, andorganisations (Baker & Nofsinger, 2010; Shukla et al.,2020) to explain real-world phenomena of stockmarkets (Thaler, 1999). Behavioural finance theoryemerged only in the 1980s with the research ofpsychologists Kahneman and Tversky. Inspired byfindings on heuristics affecting judgements (Tversky &Kahnemann, 1974), Kahneman and Tversky (1979)introduced Prospect Theory (PT), which is consideredone of the most influential models in the field ofdecision-making under risk (cf. Barberis, 2013; Zahera& Bansal, 2018).PT frames value to gains and losses instead of finalassets. It suggests that decision-makers, whenevaluating possible, certain, or probable gains andlosses, rather follow a risk-aversive path in the case ofpositive events (gains) while opting for risk-seeking inchoices involving sure losses. They are prone toevaluating changes in outcome rather than absolutemagnitude, furthered by limited abilities to distinguishbetween certainty and probabilities (Kahneman &Tversky, 1979). Subsequently, PT was advanced into“Cumulative Prospect Theory” (CPT), which employsa cumulative weighting function and extends touncertain and risky prospects. It suggests four types ofrisk attitudes: risk aversion for gains of highprobability and losses of low probability; risk seekingfor gains of low probability and losses of highprobability (Tversky & Kahneman, 1992). Otherauthors challenged the traditional axioms of EUT tobetter understand anomalies in financial marketsarising from psychological factors (Kapoor & Prosad,2017; Statman, 2014). The following section reviewsthe main biases in behavioural finance, thusconcentrating on the micro-perspective relevant to thisstudy.Behavioural biases in financial decision-makingBehavioural biases fall into two broad categories,emotional and cognitive, both leading to irrationalassessments
	. Examples for the first category are regretaversion, loss aversion, confirmation bias, and self-control bias, while overconfidence, anchoring, herding,or framing are examples for cognitive biases. Cognitivebiases include heuristics, often referred to as mentalshortcuts, which simplify complex decision-makingprocesses and reduce the cognitive resources requiredfor problem-solving (Pompian, 2006).Various studies list numerous behavioural biases, whichappear to overlap or sometimes even conflict with eachother (Davies & Brooks, 2017). Analysing 123 researcharticles, Zahera and Bansal (2018) identified 17 biases,of which overconfidence, disposition effect, herdingeffect, and loss aversion gained the highest researchinterest.Considering the complexities of delimiting the full© Udo Bomnüter1, Brigitte Kleinselbeck1, Heiko Reusch1, Hendrik Schmidt2 (2023).

	No Limits? Effects of FOMO and Gamification on Individual Investment Behaviour in Neo-broker Stock Trading 5range of biases, the following outline focuses on fivepronounced biases, which have all been related toFOMO respectively gamification in recent studies(Barber et al., 2020; Barton et al., 2015; Han, 2019;Mesly & Racicot, 2017; Oyster, 2018).Overconfidence Overconfidence is defined as people’s overestimationof their abilities to successfully perform a task or by anoverrating of their performance relative to that ofothers (American Psychological Association [APA],n.d.-a). As evidenced by Odean (1998) and Phan et al.(2020), there appears to be a causal relationshipbetween stock gains and trading volume attributable tooverconfidence bias. An increase in gains leadsinvestors to have more confidence in the stock andtrade more aggressively. Overconfident investors tendto overreact to private information while undervaluingpublic information. They are also more likely to traderisky assets because they misjudge the risk (Phan et al.,2020).Disposition effectShefrin and Statman (1985) first formally investigatedthe disposition effect in the context of mutual fundtrading. They propose that people hold stocks withgains too short and stocks with losses too long becauseinvestors do not perceive the outcomes objectively(Odean, 1999). Recent studies support the dispositioneffect. Brettschneider et al. (2021) find that investorsare more likely to sell a gaining stock when theproportion of losing stocks in their portfolio is high.Moreover, their propensity to realise a stock is higheron the same day when selling another stock.Herding biasBaddeley (2010) defines herd behaviour as “thephenomenon of individuals deciding to follow othersand imitating group behaviours rather than decidingindependently and atomistically on the basis of theirown, private information” (p. 282). In stock markets,investors tend to follow decisions by other investorsrather than relying on self-collected information(Zahera & Bansal, 2018). This appears less evident forinstitutional investors than for retail investors (Merli &Rogers, 2013). However, even professional tradersshow herding in uncertain stock markets (Cipriani &Guatino, 2008).Herding continues to develop online, where socialmedia facilitates information sharing. Aloosh et al.(2021) provide evidence that herding occurs beyondbrief short squeeze periods caused by social media as akey source of information.Anchoring biasAnchoring can be defined as a “common humantendency to rely too heavily, or “anchor” on one trait orpiece of information when making decisions” (Zaiane,2015, p. 14). In the context of trading, investors tend tobe slow to adjust when new information is presentedbecause their decision is anchored by previousobservations (Zaiane, 2015), e.g., a stock’s acquisitionprice. The anchoring bias is more likely to occur insituations under uncertainty or risk (Kahneman &Tversky, 1979). One of the reasons is that individualstend to overestimate the probability of conjunctiveevents compared to disjunctive events.Gambler’s fallacyGambler's fallacy occurs when people fail to recognisethe independence of chance events, leading to theerroneous belief that a chance event’s outcome can bepredicted based on previous events (APA, n.d.-b). Thisis caused by a subjective probability assessment that anoutcome is due in a series of chance events and is morelikely to appear than by random chance (Sundali &Croson, 2006). The underlying principle,representativeness bias, is a cognitive heuristic thatendows people with a fast response reflex based on pastexperiences that appear (erroneously) familiar(Kahneman & Tversky 1972, 1979). In the context offinancial behaviour, gambler’s fallacy comes into playwhen a similarity between random processes is wronglyinterpreted by an investor as a predictive relationship(Rakesh, 2013). There is evidence that financialliteracy has a negative effect on gambler’s fallacy(Rasool & Ullah, 2020)
	.In summary, PT and its derivatives do not deny thatinvestment decisions should be rational. However, theyshow that there are behavioural biases strong enough totrigger irrational investment decisions. This happens ata rather subconscious level, while an investor mayassume to act rationally. Investing biases in turn arecaused by various factors. Besides traditionalpersonality traits, which may influence an investor’slikelihood to engage in risk-prone or risk-averseinvestment behaviour (Aren & Nayman Hamamci,2020), these include FOMO and gamification.© Udo Bomnüter1, Brigitte Kleinselbeck1, Heiko Reusch1, Hendrik Schmidt2 (2023).

	No Limits? Effects of FOMO and Gamification on Individual Investment Behaviour in Neo-broker Stock Trading 6Fear of missing out (FOMO)The concept of “fear of missing out” (FOMO) is aglobal psychological phenomenon that has been relatedto the use of social media (Gupta & Sharma, 2021).First explored by marketing strategist Dan Herman(2000) in the context of brand loyalty, the conceptrefers to an individual’s “pervasive apprehension thatothers might be having rewarding experiences fromwhich one is absent”, linked to the “desire to staycontinuously connected” with others’ activities(Przybylski et al., 2013, p. 1841). Following theperception of missing out on something, the affectedperson will behave compulsively to maintain theirsocial connections. (Gupta & Sharma, 2021).FOMO has been conceptualised by Przybylski et al.(2013) using self-determination theory (SDT),developed by Deci and Ryan (1985), as an approach tohuman motivation and personality. SDT examinesfactors influencing intrinsic motivation, self-regulation,and mental well-being based on the fulfilment of innatepsychological needs, i.e., competence, autonomy, andrelatedness with others (Ryan & Deci, 2000).Przybylski et al. (2013) propose that FOMO resultsfrom deficits in satisfying these needs. Combiningresults from three studies, they demonstrate thatperceiving lower levels of needs fulfilment will lead tohigher levels of FOMO, which are associated withincreased social media engagement, especially amongyounger males.In their research review, Alutaybi et al. (2020) identifyfive primary contexts where social media usersexperience FOMO and the associated fears. Table 1(Appendix ) provides an overview.Not every kind of FOMO is relevant in the context ofthis study. Our research focuses on the fear of missingout on investment-related information and theaccording trading gains, i.e., monetary rewards, ratherthan missing out on rewarding social experiences. Thisdivision is essential, as monetary rewards cannot simplybe equated with social ones (e.g., Kahneman & Deaton,2010; Clor-Proell et al., 2020). We identified sevenkinds of FOMO in the classification by Alutaybi et al.(2020) that can be related to retail investment (cf.Table 1).Retail investors with high levels of FOMO will befundamentally aversive to missing out on tradingopportunities (Potsaid & Venkataraman, 2022),especially in social environments where friends orfamily “brag” about their trading profits (Jennings,2021; Laurent, 2021). Likewise, perceiving posts andmentions from others currently investing in a stock andmaking profits while not investing themselves isexpected to create FOMO among users. This willpresumably positively affect users’ willingness to investthemselves, even if the stock in question is alreadyovervalued (Delfabbro et al., 2021).GamificationThe term “gamification” came to prominence in theearly 2010s and refers to the “transfer and use of gamedesign elements in non-game contexts” (Deterding etal., 2011, p.1). In contrast to fully developed games,gamification borrows singular game design elementsand transfers them to different usage scenarios,analogue and digital alike. The central idea behindgamification is to trigger and influence user behaviour.Meta-analyses of existing studies by Hamari et al.(2014) and Looyestyn et al. (2017) show thatgamification is linked to increased loyalty, motivation,and engagement. These positive effects can bemeasured in different areas, ranging from gamifiedlanguage-learning apps (Dehghanzadeh et al., 2021) tohealth-related programmes (Cotton & Panel, 2019).Underlying principles are shaping all games. Amongthose are voluntary participation, a stated objective,rules, and a feedback system (McGonigal, 2011).Especially the latter plays a central role in game designas the feedback system is applied to trigger motivation.SDT (see above) suggests that extrinsic rewards maynegatively interact with intrinsic motivation if they arenot task or performance-contingent and do not supportcompetence, autonomy, and relatedness, and vice versa(Deci & Ryan, 2008, 2012)
	.Feedback in digital games is usually provided by theimmediate display of performance-contingent progressnumbers to trigger extrinsic and intrinsic motivation,thus ensuring that gamers continue playing. For thisreason, the design of rewards and feedback is central togame designers (Salen & Zimmerman, 2004; Schell,2008). This intense focus on intrinsic and extrinsicmotivation is also reflected in the design of gamifiedapplications and interfaces (Alsawaier, 2018; Mekler etal., 2017), where game components such as badges,high scores, progress bars, and leaderboards areextensively used. They create a “feedback loop”,ensuring that players receive permanent rewardfeedback (Deterding, 2015, p. 39). This interactionstimulates extrinsic motivation since received points© Udo Bomnüter1, Brigitte Kleinselbeck1, Heiko Reusch1, Hendrik Schmidt2 (2023). No Limits?

	No Limits? Effects of FOMO and Gamification on Individual Investment Behaviour in Neo-broker Stock Trading 7provide an immediate assessment of a user’sperformance, whereas badges show a user’sconsistency, and leaderboards enable a competitivecomparison to other users (Linehan et al., 2015).Sailer et al. (2017) conducted an experiment whichshowed that feedback features, including badges orleaderboards, positively impacted user behaviour.Moreover, game design elements that provide promptfeedback were considered more significant than othercomponents.The adoption of game design elements in e-bankingwas investigated early by Rodrigues et al. (2016). Intheir study, they found that bank customers werewilling to accept and use gamified applications tomanage their investments, with ease of use, enjoymentand perceived socialness as central factors.Conceptual FrameworkNeo-brokers like Robinhood or Trade Republic makeit easy and inexpensive to enter the stock market. Theyuse gamification elements such as those describedabove. Additionally, they benefit from FOMO-relatedcalls-to-action that create high demand for certainstocks traded at NBAs. Our research model linksFOMO and gamification to behavioural biases ininvestment decision making among NBA users. Sincethese biases result from using NBAs and associatedsocial media channels, they can be framed as onlinemedia effects on financial markets (Agarwal et al.,2019).In the given context, the criterion variable, irrationalinvestment behaviour (IIB), comprises all five investingbiases outlined above, each capturing a different aspectof retail investment behaviour:Overconfidence bias assumes that investors tend tooverestimate their ability to perform a task successfullywhile misjudging the risk. (APA, n.d.-a; Phan et al.,2020)Disposition effect refers to an irrational aversion to lossrealisation. Investors tend to sell winners/gains tooearly and hold losses too long (Odean, 1998; Shefrin &Statman, 1985).Anchoring bias is the irrational tendency to rely tooheavily on past information when making decisions.Consequently, investors tend to be slow to adjust.(Zaiane, 2015).Herding bias involves the irrational alignment of one’sbehaviour with the behaviour of others rather thanrelying on independent information, despite the risk ofreduced returns (Merli & Rogers, 2013; Zahera &Bansal, 2018).Gambler’s fallacy occurs when a similarity betweenrandom processes is interpreted by investors as apredictive relationship between outcomes (Rakesh,2013), thus leading to adverse investments.We further distinguish between the descriptor variablesFOMO and gamification used as factors for ourresearch model.FOMO ,as the fear of missing out on (investment)opportunities, has been linked to mobile and socialmedia early on (e.g., Grant & O'Donohoe, 2007;Przybylski et al., 2013). Neo-brokers as tradingplatforms are of particular importance in this study.Research by Potsaid et al. (2022) shows thatrestrictions to trading at NBAs affect retail investorswith high FOMO levels more than those with lowlevels.FOMO has been linked to overconfidence and risk-seeking (Bonaparte, 2021), herd behaviour andgambler’s fallacy (Shiva et al., 2020), and loss aversionand herd behaviour (Gupta & Shrivastava, 2021), witha tendency to increase investing biases. This aligns withFOMO's general association with problematictechnology, internet use, and negative affectivity (Elhaiet al., 2021). Consequently, we expect FOMO toreinforce irrational investment behaviour.H1:Higher levels of trading-related FOMO among usersof NBAs will have a positive impact on their IIB.Neo-broker trading apps such as Robinhood or TradeRepublic employ several game design elements. Forexample, both NBAs display the stock portfolio as ageneral “score” and use animated badges which depictcertain events, such as a friend invite. Additionally,Trade Republic offers a list of most popular stocks inthe community, which can be considered aleaderboard
	. Overall, these gamification elementscreate a positive feedback loop which supposedlymotivates users to continue trading.Therefore, the predicting role of gamification is to betested to show if and to what extent it can be amotivational driver.© Udo Bomnüter1, Brigitte Kleinselbeck1, Heiko Reusch1, Hendrik Schmidt2 (2023).

Therefore, we expect the frequency oftrading to moderate the effects of FOMO andgamification.H3a: The frequency of trading (per time interval) willinteract with FOMO and gamification with effects onretail investors’ IIB.Likewise, studies have related trading experience toseveral investing biases (Chen et al., 2007; Huang &Goo, 2008; Kawshala et al., 2020). Drawing on thesefindings, we expect trading experience to moderate theeffects of FOMO and gamification.H3b: Trading experience (in years) will interact withFOMO and gamification with effects on retail investors’IIB.We further incorporate age (in years) and gender ascontrol variables in our model.Figure 1 ( Appendix ) shows the complete researchmodel with the descriptor variables FOMO andgamification, the two moderator variables, the twocontrol variables, and the hypotheses presented.MethodologyTo address the research question and its hypotheses,OLS regression analysis was conducted according toour conceptual model (Fig. 1). Research design andsampling will be introduced in the followingsubchapters.Research designWe created a standardised online questionnaireconsisting of two sections. In the first section, a filterquestion (“Neo-broking activity”) was asked to checkfor the participants’ eligibility. We also sorted outrespondents without any trading activities andinfrequent social media users. The section furthercontained questions about participants’ social mediausage and average trading amount. In addition,participants had to indicate their trading frequency andexperience as possible moderator variables.Furthermore, we captured the demographic variables“Gender” and “Age” as possible confounders.The second section measured independent anddependent variables using 5-point Likert scalequestions. At first, the independent variables –gamification and FOMO – were addressed.FOMO was measured based on the established FOMOscale by Przybylski et al. (2013). Considering theirrelatedness to trading behaviour discussed above, wereduced the original number of items to five with anoverarching relevance. We then added two specificallyinvestment-related items, drawing on the reflections byClor-Proell et al. (2019) in their development of a scaleto measure FOMO on investment information (I-FoMO). Table 2 ( Appendix ) overviews the final sevenitems and their association with the two concepts.“Gamification” was measured using three items, eachaiming at one of three interacting game-designingcomponents: high scores (points), leaderboards(ranking), and badges as feedback display (Sailer et al.,2017).Our dependent variable “Irrational InvestmentBehaviour” (IIB) was measured with an index valuecapturing the five biases: Overconfidence, dispositioneffect, anchoring bias, herd behaviour and gambler’sfallacy. We used two items for each bias, exceptoverconfidence and anchoring bias, which weremeasured with one item each to account for theirassumed relatedness (e.g., Russo & Schoemaker,1992).Pre-testTo check the questionnaire’s technical and content-related quality, including measurement validity, a pre-test was carried out in January 2022. A total of sixretail investors, three male and three female, 20 to 38years old, executed the pre-test. Due to their feedback,the instructions and wording of some of the questionswere revised.SamplingAccording to a survey by the German Stock Institute,an estimated 12.1 million Germans are consideredretail investors (Deutsches Aktieninstitut, 2022a)

	No Limits? Effects of FOMO and Gamification on Individual Investment Behaviour in Neo-broker Stock Trading 9share of neo-broker users is 19.3%. To address thispopulation, we applied purposive sampling based on aconcentration principle: Several Instagram accountsdedicated to stocks were contacted and asked to sharethe questionnaire with their followers (e.g.,@techaktien with 122.000 followers).From January 19 to 21, 2022, a total of 1,090 peopletook part in the online survey. After filtering for theuse of neo-brokers, retail investment activities andregular social-media usage, 735 questionnaires wereconsidered for further analyses.ResultsThe respondents were on average 27 years old(SD=6.23 years). According to common classifications(e.g., Dimock, 2021), they can be divided into four agegroups:Generation Z born 1997-2012 (n=346)Millennials born 1981-1996 (n=376)Generation X born 1965-1980 (n=11)Boomers born 1946-1964 (n=2)In total, 677 respondents (92.1%) were male, 56female, and two diverse. This gender and agediscrepancy mirrors the actual dominance of youngmale users confirmed by other studies (e.g., Kritikos etal., 2022).Regarding trading frequency, more than half of therespondents (51.7%) trade monthly, while 37.6% tradeat least every two weeks, with only 10.7% trading everysix months or less. More than a third (35.5%) havemore than two years of trading experience, roughly40% one to two years, and 24.6% have been trading forless than one year. The median investment per trade isbetween EUR 200 and 500, with 28.2% of therespondents investing more than EUR 500. 695respondents (95%) access social media multiple timesper day.All five investing biases are present in our data set,ranging in their mean values from 1.6 to 3.7 on a scalefrom 1 to 5. However, the calculation of Cronbach’salpha for assessing the IIB scale’s internal consistencyled to excluding the items addressing overconfidenceand anchoring bias. The adjusted index used in ouranalysis showed a mean value of 2.11 (SD=0.63). Themean index values for the FOMO and gamificationindices are 2.58 (SD=0.75) and 2.44 (SD=1.07),respectively.Regression analysisTo validate our conceptual model, we applied stepwiseOLS regression analysis. Table 3 ( Appendix ) reports theresults.The adjusted R2(.174) indicates that irrationalinvestment behaviour (IIB) among neo-broker users isonly partially explained by the model variables. Still,we find that FOMO (b=.314, p<.001) significantlyrelates to IIB in support of H1. Gamification, however,had to be excluded due to its weak contribution to themodel. H2 is thus not supported. In addition, tradingexperience has a significant, albeit weak negativeinfluence on IIB (b=-.061, p<.001) in support of H3b.There also is a significant but negligible effect oftrading frequency on IIB (b=.0006, p<.005). Wetherefore partially confirm H3a. The inclusion of thecontrol variables age and gender did not significantlyimpact the main results, thus affirming the robustnessof our findings.DiscussionBy linking FOMO and gamification to establishedbiases from behavioural finance, we tried to determinethe obstructive impact of social-media related factorson investment decision-making among NBA users. Ourresults show that FOMO is the most important factor.This finding ties in with Shiva et al. (2020), underliningthe relatedness of FOMO to investing biases. Theeffect on IIB is slightly mitigated by tradingexperience, which may be explained by learning effectsand minimally strengthened by trading frequency, thelatter indicating an increased engagement typicallyrelated to FOMO. Against our expectations,gamification did not substantially contribute to IIB.Considering these findings, the most relevant result ofour study is that contrary to the criticism frompractitioners (e.g., Khan, 2021) and academia (e.g., vander Heide & Želinský, 2020), FOMO and gamificationaffect the trading behaviour of NBA users only to alimited extent
	. The largest share of irrationalinvestment behaviour seems to be caused by factorsbeyond this study, which are neither specific to neo-brokers nor social media related but rather part ofusers’ personalities, with FOMO serving as areinforcer.© Udo Bomnüter1, Brigitte Kleinselbeck1, Heiko Reusch1, Hendrik Schmidt2 (2023).

	No Limits? Effects of FOMO and Gamification on Individual Investment Behaviour in Neo-broker Stock Trading 10Implications for managersOur results provide several insights for managers ofonline-trading platforms. They indicate that perceivedFOMO and susceptibility to gamification cannot fullyexplain irrational investing. NBA users may tradenearly as irrationally as other retail investors, with amoderate amplifying effect, especially from socialmedia transmitted FOMO.However, being limited in their effects on IIB does notdiminish the appeal of features that explicitly employFOMO and gamification concepts. Neo-brokers maybenefit from combining favourable conditions of usewith functions like message boards and gamificationelements that conform to their young target groups’social media environment. For millennials and Gen Z,social media and digital services are essential to theirlives. According to a PWC (2020) study, 95% of GenZ consumers actively use social media.Our results show that most neo-broker users areyounger than the average shareholder in Germany(Deutsches Aktieninstitut, 2022b). Consistent withfindings by Kritikos et al. (2022), there is a clearindication that neo-brokers enable young adults toparticipate in capital markets. Moreover, therespondents’ trading frequency is relatively high, with89.3% trading at least monthly, while 28.2% investmore than EUR 500 per trade. Overall, NBA usersform a very attractive target group, especiallyconsidering their customer lifetime value.Regarding the vulnerability of young social media usersto FOMO in general and the discovered amplificationof IIB through FOMO, corporate social responsibilitymust be considered, too. As FOMO has been related todetrimental effects on people’s well-being (e.g.,Przybylski et al., 2013), neo-brokers might want to takeprotective measures for their users to avoid a badreputation. They might either refer to concepts fromthe “FOMO Reduction method” (FoMO-R) suggestedby Alutaybi et al. (2020), e.g., through explicit ethicalconducts; or employ governance mechanisms, e.g., bymanaging message boards and providing additional real-time information.Limitations and future researchIt should be noted, though, that our data collection usedpurposive sampling based on the social platformInstagram, which might result in limitations of theresults’ representativeness despite matching specificsample characteristics with secondary data. Futurestudies should aim to employ random sampling instead.Furthermore, our sample’s share of female and diverseusers is less than 8%. This may have been too small toallow for significant effects based on genderdifferences found in related studies (e.g., Barber &Odean, 2001; Przybylski et al., 2013). Subsequentstudies could increase non-males’ shares to investigatesuch effects. Alternatively, for enlarging the scope ofresearch, the number and kind of biases addressedmight be varied and connected to quantitative financialoutcomes.Another research area linked to central aspects of ourstudy would be investigating factors that determine thechoice of neo-brokers compared to traditional tradingservices and whether social media, FOMO andgamification elements play a role in this choice. Ourresearch may also be fruitfully expanded to behaviouralfactors of investments in cryptocurrencies and NFTs,which have increased in popularity, particularly amongyounger investor groups.As these limitations and suggestions exemplify, there isa need for future research, especially considering thecurrent transformations of the financial sector inGermany and beyond.

This study discusses the psychological phenomenon known as the ‘Fear of Missing Out’ (FOMO) by elucidating its psychological basis and definition and why and how its effects are amplified under the influence of social media and social trading media. The study will demonstrate how FOMO and human interaction with social media and social trading networks can lead to irrational decision-making, financial risk-taking, and harm to personal and family wealth and psychological well-being. It emphasizes the importance of recognizing these effects and making more rational and informed choices in trading and invest-ment to avoid gambling behaviour, copy investing, and trading, following the traders in the social trading network, which leads to excessive risk-taking. This study aims to utilize the advancements in behavioural finance and neural processes to explain the mechanism and impact of FOMO, try-ing to give a basis to safeguard individual e-traders from financial market errors and protect their personal and family wealth.Keywords: FOMO, social trading networks, online traders, copy trading, decision-makingJEL Classification: G410; D140
	Boyan Ivantchev, Madlen Ivantcheva  60IntroductionThe first scientific endeavour exploring the concept and impact of the Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) phenomenon emerged in 1996. This idea demonstrates how FOMO can serve as a potent emotional driver, significantly influencing consumer behaviour [Herman, 2000]. Several years later, McGinnis introduced the concepts and abbreviations of both phenom -ena, nowadays known as Fear of Missing Out [FOMO] and Fear of a Better Option (FOBO), respectively [McGinnis, 2004]. Gradually, the abbreviations FOMO and FOBO gained increas -ing popularity as conceptual terms. Particularly, the abbreviation FOMO became widely recognized, finding its place in various English language dictionaries in 2013. Moreover, it permeates scientific literature through numerous studies, including those conducted in the fields of behavioural finance and neuroscience. By mid-2021, over 11 million articles were available on the Internet concerning the FOMO phenomenon, with thousands of them being scholarly articles and studies. In just two years, by October 2023, the number of these articles has more than tripled, reaching 36.7 million. This exceptionally popular phenomenon might be summarized as follows: “…pervasive apprehension that others might be having rewarding experiences from which one is absent, FOMO is characterized by the desire to stay contin -ually connected with what others are doing” [Przybylski et al., 2013, p. 1841]. In a broader understanding, the FOMO effect can be defined as a sense of discomfort and exclusion, trig -gered by the knowledge or information that our friends possess something we lack, or that our friends are engaged in something more meaningful and significant than what we have [Abel et al., 2016]. As a result of the popularity of FOMO, its definition has emerged in the dictionary of English words and terms [Merriam-Webster, 2021], where it is described as: “fear of not being included in something (such as an interesting or enjoyable activity) that others are experiencing” . In the 21st century, social media and the World Wide Web have become fundamental tools for gaining information about our friends’ and acquaintances’ lives and activities, particularly among the younger generation.1 Here we are using phenomenological, cognitive, and deconstructive analysis as methodological approaches to examine carefully the origins of the Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) phenomenon and its impact on the trading and investment behaviour of individual e-traders and investors. This inquiry is particularly pertinent within the context of the markedly increasing significance of social media and social trading networks in the 21st century.1 https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/tween-and-teen-health/in-depth/teens-and-social-media-use/art-20474437 [accessed: 20.06.2023].
	FOMO effect: social media and online traders 61Review of the literatureFOMO: social media harmsThe omnipresence of social media in our daily activities is giving abundant possibilities and is fostering and amplifying the human desire constantly to know, observe, and follow other humans’ activities [Abel et al., 2016, p. 36]. As a result of the FOMO effect, a certain degree of addiction and compulsive or excessive social media usage has been observed among indi -viduals [Blackwell et al., 2017; Tandon et al., 2021]. The FOMO effect is also associated with narcissistic admiration and rivalry among social media users [Jabeen et al., 2023]. Scholars and researchers contend that the assertions and postulates of the social comparison theory play a significant role in the widespread penetration, popularity, influence, and addiction to social media in contemporary society [Burnell et al., 2019]. A theory of social comparison processes [Festinger, 1954] presents key starting points relating to the human desire for self-evaluation and comparison with others. These points include:a) Human individuals have an inherent drive to evaluate themselves positively.b) They compare themselves with others in the absence of objective information.c) When objective sources for self-evaluation are unavailable, they seek information and compare themselves with individuals similar to them.The foundational perspective of the interpersonal comparison “given a range of possible persons for comparison, someone close to one‘s own ability or opinion will be chosen for comparison“ [Festinger, 1954, p. 121], is implicitly embraced by his followers [Krueger, 2000, p. 323]. Simultaneously, the phenomenon of social comparison is identified as detrimental to individuals’ well-being [Schwartz, 2005]. Social media addiction is particularly pronounced among adolescents who utilize social media as a means of fulfilling their psychological needs [Przybylski et al., 2013]. A study reveals that the increased need for belongingness and popularity among adolescents is associated with higher levels of Facebook usage, and this relationship is mediated by the presence and influence of the FOMO effect on them. Findings demonstrate that individuals with a higher manifestation of the FOMO effect also experience elevated levels of stress related to Facebook usage [Beyens, Frison, Eggermont, 2016] and generally the FOMO effect is associated with negative emotional states, specifically characterized by feelings of loneliness, mood disturbances, boredom, and depressive states [Browne, Aruguete, McCutcheon, Medina, 2018].Social media platforms such as Y ouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter, WhatsApp, TikTok, Pinterest, and others represent the new technology of the 21st century for information dissemination and virtual social interaction. The omnipresence of social media has triggered significant scientific debate regarding their negative influence on psychological well-being and the overall threat to social media users, particularly children, adolescents, and young adults [Twenge, Joiner, Rogers, Martin, 2017; Viner et al., 2019; Mayo Clinic, 2021]. The negative 
	Boyan Ivantchev, Madlen Ivantcheva  62impact of social media, problematic social media use (PSMU), and consequently, users’ irritable behaviour (phubbing behaviour) become the subject of numerous scientific studies [Franchina et al., 2018], and investigation in the US Senate was initiated in 2021 to address concerns that Facebook and other social media platforms are detrimental to mental health, particularly among children and teenagers. Facebook employee Frances Haugen stated before the Senate subcommittee on October 4, 2021: “The result has been a system that amplifies division, extremism, and polarization – and undermining societies around the world. In some cases, this dangerous online talk has led to actual violence that harms and even kills people. In other cases, their profit-optimizing machine is generating self-harm and self-hate – especially for vulnerable groups, like teenage girls. These problems have been confirmed repeatedly by Facebook’s own internal research. ”2 One of the ‘leaked’ and publicly accessible internal studies conducted by Facebook regarding the impact of social media, specifically focusing on the influence of Instagram on teenagers, is a document from 2019 known as the Teen Mental Health Deep Dive 2019.3 Other key takeaways of the harmful influence of social media on the mental well-being of adolescents are as follows: “Harm on Instagram falls into three major categories: social comparison, social pressure, and negative interactions with other people” .FOMO: analogue vs. digital effectAccording to other scholars, social media is regarded as a kind of successor to the radio and television, without leading to effects that are significantly different from the times when the radio and television were new in a similar way [Orben, 2020]. These claims are rather rare and lack sufficient scientific evidence. The prevailing scientific literature and evidence support the notion that the phenomenon of FOMO and the feelings of anxiety, discomfort, and fear of missing out on positive and unique experiences shared by others are amplified with the emergence and omnipresence of social media. Social interaction, comparison between individuals, their lives, and achievements in social media in the 21st century is no longer an analogue process, as it was in the 20th century. Conceptually, social media and its influence are distinct from those of the old technologies of the 20th century. The nature of the radio and television as media predominantly promotes internationally renowned actresses, artists, athletes, politicians, experts, and other famous personalities, which triggers a desire for emu -lation, respect for expertise, or a need for identification with a specific idol and hero. The radio and television rarely showcase the achievements of the average representative from a specific age group, gender, profession, locality, neighborhood, university, or school, along with their accomplishments and experiences. Consequently, according to Festinger‘s theory of social comparison (we are looking for someone similar to us to compare), the radio and television 2 https://www.commerce.senate.gov/services/files/FC8A558E-824E-4914 -BEDB-3A7B1190BD49  [accessed: 01.07.2023].3 https ://about .fb.com /wp-content /uploads/2021/09/Instagram -Teen -Annotated -Research -Deck -2.pdf  [accessed: 01.07.2023].
	FOMO effect: social media and online traders 63have much less potential to trigger the FOMO effect. In the 20th century, the point of reference for comparing oneself with others was primarily based on physical encounters with similar individuals in one’s family, friendships, professional gatherings, school, university, celebra -tions, and conferences. These types of encounters did not produce 24/7 digital comparative information, and naturally, analogue, face-to-face communication did not create an overly exaggerated and distorted portrayal of others’ happy moments and successes. Therefore, the analogue environment did not create a natural setting for constant comparison like the current digital and omnipresent panopticon of social media. The constant sharing on social media of video ‘proof ’ depicting the happy family moments one experiences, the restaurants one dines at, the trips one takes, and the celebrations one attends, involving certain individuals (friends, loved ones, acquaintances, peers, colleagues), significantly accelerates and amplifies the information about how others are coping, living, and feeling almost in every moment of their lives. The more generalized perception of the truth, expertise, and the harmfulness of the Internet regarding the abundance of diverse information available is described by Tom Nichols in his book The Death of Expertise: The Campaign Against Established Knowledge and Why It Matters in the following manner: “Facts, as experts know, are not the same as knowledge or ability. And on the Internet, ‘facts’ are sometimes not even facts. In the various skirmishes in the campaigns against established knowledge, the Internet is like artillery support: a con -stant bombardment of random, disconnected information that rains down on experts and ordinary citizens alike, deafening all of us while blowing up attempts at reasonable discussion”  [Nichols, 2017, p. 107].The phenomenon of social media, in addition to facilitating comparisons with friends and acquaintances and inundating users with information and facts, has given rise to thou -sands upon thousands of subcultural vloggers and bloggers. They have become not only the subject of ‘following’ by hundreds of millions of social media users but also the subject of comparison, envy, and ultimately the detriment to the mental well-being of millions of social media users. “Why can‘t I be like him/her? They are just like me!” Those susceptible to the FOMO effect display a particular interest in what is happening to their peers, friends, and colleagues. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to pay attention to the fact that the shared information on social media is selectively curated and visually enhanced by its authors to make the photos and videos appear more appealing and beautiful [Chua, Chang, 2016]. In many cases, individuals who share information on social media tend to present an idealized and highly optimistic picture of their own lives, accomplishments, and happiness [Vogel, Rose, 2016]. The shared idyllic and happy moments of life through video content evoke feelings of insignificance and dissatisfaction in other individuals and trigger emotions such as envy and jealousy, thereby compromising the psychological well-being of social media users [Desjarlais, Tarkowski, 2021, p. 1]. The impact of social media can greatly accelerate the disappointment of its users as a result of constant comparisons with ‘friends’ and ‘friends of friends’ . It has been observed that individuals susceptible to the FOMO effect misinterpret the posts of others featuring happy and joyous moments, mistakenly believing that others have, on the whole, 
	Boyan Ivantchev, Madlen Ivantcheva  64better lives. Therefore, they fail to understand that most personal posts on social media show -case a strong psychological inclination to share primarily happy moments rather than sad or negative ones. This distorted and idealized depiction, diverging from the realities and fullness of life we experience, naturally leads to a distortion of our perception of the lives of our peers, friends, acquaintances, and colleagues and further amplifies the influence of the FOMO effect, leading to frustration and dissatisfaction with our own life. The bias of people to compare themselves on social media is confirmed by several studies [Sabatini, Sarracino, 2016, p. 3]. Understanding and comprehending the harm of the FOMO effect is of paramount importance due to the exponentially increasing number of social media users. The most popular platform, Facebook, alone boasts 2.989 billion users with a daily active user count of 2.037 billion as of April 20234 and 49% of Facebook users visit their profiles multiple times throughout the day, which is a characteristic behaviour exhibited by users of other social media platforms as well.Table 1.

S. adults conducted Jan. 25-Feb. 8, 2021, Pew Research Center [accessed: 01.07.2023].FOMO: neuroscientific evidenceThe interaction between social media users and electronic communication is different than face-to-face interaction [Blanchard et al., 2023] and is predominantly based on sharing various posts and pictures, as well as giving and receiving likes. As a result, when people interact with each other through Zoom, our brains are not processing social cues as actively as they do in real life as per the revealed neuro processes in the recent neuroimaging study [Zhao et al., 2023]. The rise of neuroscience and the establishment of neuroeconomics as a scientific disci -pline [Ivantchev, 2020] provide opportunities to apply the most contemporary and profound evidence for further elucidating the reasons behind human individuals’ irrational decisions under risk and uncertainty. Neurobiologically, the FOMO effect correlates with conditions of social inclusion, social exclusion, and the need for belonging to a particular society or group: “Moreover, the main finding of correlations analyses was that the FOMO’s score was positively 4 https://investor.fb.com/home/default.aspx and https://datareportal.com/essential-facebook-stats [accessed: 01.07.2023].
	FOMO effect: social media and online traders 65correlated with ASQ-need for approval and with right middle temporal gyrus (BA21) only during inclusion condition. Findings sustain that fear of missing out is associated to a greater sensitivity towards social inclusive experiences rather than social exclusion and with the need of belonging” [Lai, 2016, p. 516]. Neuroscience provides important evidence of neuronal acti -vation in the human brain during the highly popular practice of giving/receiving evaluations (likes) on photos/posts on social media. The brain activation in response to both receiving and giving ‘likes’ on the Instagram social media platform indicates activity in the striatum, the midbrain/VTA (Ventral Tegmental Area), and the thalamus: “Past work has documented that response in the striatum/vmPFC is associated with receipt of both monetary and social rewards [Bhanji and Delgado, 2014]. Here, our finding that giving positive social feedback is associated with response in these regions is parsimonious with a large body of previous work suggesting that the striatum and vmPFC are activated when one makes monetary contributions to others [e.g. Harbaugh et al., 2007; Telzer et al., 2010], and provides social support to loved ones [e.g. Inagaki and Eisenberger, 2012; Sherman et al., 2018, p. 704]. Activation of similar brain regions and the experience of pleasure when receiving monetary or social rewards explains our strong desire to receive ‘likes’ in social media and a strong desire to participate in them, which amplifies the influence of the FOMO effect. Therefore, we can speculate that a strong wish to obtain more ‘likes’ , especially among teens from lower-income families, is a kind of compensatory mechanism to swap the money pleasure with the ‘likes’ pleasure which is in line with their strong addiction to social media. As a corollary we argue that this mechanism of brain stimulation is leading into fractional and copy trading wishing to become in a short time visibly reacher/happier, which is actually similar to gambling behaviour.FOMO effect and its influence on our behaviour  in the financial marketsThe FOMO effect can influence the decisions and behaviour of both non-professional and professional traders and investors. This is particularly evident in sharp upward trends in the financial markets, which triggers a strong desire in individuals and households (groups who obtain financial information predominantly from social media) to join the market trend not to miss out on the golden opportunity to profit, simultaneously comparing themselves, triggered by the FOMO effect, with others who are declaring benefits from the uptrend. We can also find an interrelation between FOMO and regret aversion. This interrelation potentiates the irrationality, especially in non-professional traders/investors (but also not excluding the effect on institutional investors) pushing them to run for the trend-chasing and for golden opportunities – as per the most significant media attention [Blanchett, 2023] available at any certain moment of time.In social media trading information, opinions, and views about market trends and finan -cial instruments are widely shared. Some trading platforms like eToro have access to and are 
	Boyan Ivantchev, Madlen Ivantcheva  66organically connected with Twitter, Facebook, Y ouTube, Instagram, LinkedIn, and TikTok, enabling members to share their trading positions, results, and comments, and communicate with one another. The sub-social network – the Social Trading Network, originated from the so-called Mirror Trading phenomenon, reaching hundreds of specialized trading platforms with a significant market size of over 9.3 bn USD as of the year 2022.5 Easily accessible trading platforms such as eToro connect traders from around the world to share trading strategies, ideas, results, and forecasts. These types of trading platforms combine the functionality of social media and online trading, allowing users to follow easily financial instruments and traders they like, interact with other users, and engage in discussions on various topics. The user profile contains information about all the activity within the social trading network – posts and comments, biography, trading strategy, trades, and more. Information about the profit factor, trade profit/loss, risk rating, the composition of the investment portfolio, and other relevant details are available. Social trading networks offer the opportunity for anyone to follow and replicate the trading strategy and trades of a chosen user to do so (the signal provider to be followed by the signal followers) within seconds using their smartphone. This is known as the option for automatic copy trading, which involves selecting a specific trader, investing funds, and proportionally distributing profits based on the invested amount.Table 2.

	FOMO effect: social media and online traders 67perspectives on specific stocks, and successful trading transactions amplify mercilessly the influence of the FOMO effect among hundreds of thousands of individual online traders who are lusted not to lose on the golden opportunity. The e-democratization of investing and trading leads to a boyish gamification like “Let’s try the luck” and a betting style of trading/investing. Easy-to-use and zero-commission trading applets, fractional and margin trading/investing with just a few US dollars, easy money transfers have led to socialization and vulgarization of trading and investing, and turns investments from a knowledge-based activity into a mere gambling wager. Technological predispositions, the fintech industry, and the social media trading news bombardment, psychologically are pushing many individuals with no financial literacy to fear being left out of the game and to copy the trading/investing game looking for likes and easy money. This behaviour of online traders/investors is based on reduced ‘psychic cost’ [Schulp, 2021, p. 523] of investing and trading. However, the easiness of trading, we do argue, cannot be perceived as a positive result, as it is stated by Schulp. Decreased psychic cost of trading/investing is leading to a higher rate of fast thinking and irrational decision making, which ultimately rises the risk for the online traders/investors to fall under the influence of FOMO. Easiness and heuristic decision-making are vulgarising the trading/investing in the complex and stochastic systems (financial market) to a just copy actions. Just like the slogan of eToro is yelling on TV screens “Originality is Overrated. Smart People Copy Smart People” . Such a vulgar and harmful strategy can expose beginners, and not only, to the strategy of professional traders with much bigger portfolios, different risk appetites, or/and professionals hidden behind ‘average’ users who want to move certain financial instruments up or down with the help of silent sheep who are copying trades. In the case when the signal provider is really ‘average’ but successful – as per the data of the trading network – we still do not know whether their success is the result of their knowledge and abilities [Huddart,1999] or whether he/she is a second or third-hand signal provider.An example of copy trading influence on social networks is the behaviour of individual retail investors to meme stocks (financial instruments that have become extremely popular on social media). GameStop (GME) stocks became highly popular in 2021 on the Wall Street Bets forum (Reddit social network), triggering a massive demand by retail investors. As a result, there was a tremendous increase in the volatility of GME stock prices, which had stable prices throughout 2020 and which were at a level of $ 17.25 in early January 2021. Due to their popularity on social media and increased trading volume, the closing prices of GME on January 26, 2021, reached $ 147.98, compared to $ 76.79 the previous day and $ 39.36 a week earlier. On January 26, 2021, Tesla’s CEO, Elon Musk, shared a post on Twitter with a link to WallStreetBets, where discussions about GME were the main topic. One day after Musk’s tweet, the price of GME shares more than doubled to $ 347.51 on January 27, and on January 28, it reached a peak of $ 483 before collapsing and ending the trading session at $ 193.60. Several months later, the closing price of these meme stocks on September 27, 2021 was $ 189.48. Such price volatility demonstrates the significant potential for losses that retail investors exposed to the FOMO effect may face.
	Boyan Ivantchev, Madlen Ivantcheva  68Another of such examples is when on October 22, 2021 the administrators of the Nas -daq index halted trading 13 times for the shares of a publicly traded company Digital World Acquisition Corp. (DW AC). This special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) dramatically increased its price and trading volumes following the news that it intends to merge with the start-up of Trump Media & Technology Group and its Truth Social application, thus making the company public and launching a new project in social media by former US President Donald Trump. The prices of DW AC shares on October 22, 2021, were with a trading range from $ 67.96 to $ 175.00, with a closing price of $ 94.20 and a traded volume of over 133 million shares, while the average volume for the company’s shares is around 33 million shares. The movement of the stock prices of this company for the period from October 6 to October 22, 2021, appears even more dramatic, ranging from $ 9.8401 to $ 175.00.Such enormous volatility exposes investors to significant risks and potential losses due to the FOMO effect and meme investing. Certainly, retail investors trading with, for example, $ 300 may argue that they have little to lose. However, those who display irrational behaviour when investing small amounts tend to approach decision-making similarly in other spheres, including larger financial investments and decisions when they arise. In a sense, those who engage in copy investing/trading, following a selected trader from social investment networks or the most popular financial instruments, find solace in the fact that if they lose money, they lose it alongside numerous other traders. Consequently, the psychological pain is signifi -cantly lower compared to the realization of losses resulting from an independent (original) trading strategy. However, this does not change the fact that such a behaviour ultimately leads to actual financial losses and gambling under the influence of the FOMO effect. The investment process must be based on slow thinking and a rational approach that depends on objectively defined tactical and strategic investment goals. This process is entirely different from the irrational approach associated with the FOMO effect. A powerful driver behind the behaviour of imitating the actions of others is the inherent human tendency to compare oneself to others. However, comparing oneself to others and engaging in irrational imitative actions in financial markets cannot rely on objective criteria. This is because other investors and traders may have entirely different family statuses, ages, wealth, stop losses, investment horizons, and tactical and strategic investment goals. They may even have specific manip -ulative objectives, such as promoting actions to influence market prices in one direction or another by enticing retail investors to buy or sell a particular financial instrument. The influence of the FOMO effect and copy investing and trading, by following the traders in the social trading network leads to excessive risk-taking [Apesteguia, Oechssler, Weidenholzer, 2020, p. 5608] and an inability to build one’s long-term investment strategy – tailored to its specificity and risk-return. These individual investors who succumb to the FOMO effect and the fear of not winning like others, often gravitate toward highly risky and socially trending meme stocks (herd behaviour), thereby drastically increasing the overall risk of their invest -ment portfolio and risking significant losses of personal and family wealth: “…agents choose to make investment decisions that are similar to those of the rest of the population to avoid 
	FOMO effect: social media and online traders 69being poor when their cohort is wealthy. If agents are sensitive to the wealth of others, making different investment decisions than the crowd increases the risk of their relative wealth. The riskier the technology, the greater is agents’ concern for being left behind, and the stronger the herding effect” [DeMarzo, Kaniel, Kremer, 2007, p. 751].It is also possible to interpret the FOMO effect on the financial markets and social media usage in terms of socioeconomic inequality. Teenagers living in low-income households nearly twice as much as the users from families with incomes exceeding $ 75,0006 and low-income teenagers give up on social media harder than others.7 We can speculate scientifically that a stronger impact of the FOMO effect on lower-income households can also be observed in their activities on financial markets. Specifically, this pertains to the hyperactive participation of individual retail investors in ‘meme stocks’ i.e. highly risky stocks.SummaryA Theory of social comparison processes by Leon Festinger presents the fundamental hypoth -eses that serve as a starting point for understanding and interpreting the inherent human desire for self-evaluation and comparison with others. The 21st-century modern era intensifies our desire for self-evaluation, narcissism, and comparison with others due to the omnipresent social media, which increasingly dominates the thoughts, behaviour, and psychological state of billions of people from various religions, races, genders, ages, and social and wealth status. The FOMO effect is one of the harmful manifestations of the intrinsic driver for self-evaluation and social comparison in human beings. The fear of missing out on something important or exciting, comparing our personal lives, successes, and achievements to others, increasingly governs our daily lives, thoughts, and behaviours. There are reasons to believe that the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated forced social isolation and physical distancing were partially substituted by increased online communication and extended time spent on social media, leading to an even more amplified detrimental influence of the FOMO phenomenon [Gioia et al., 2021]. The FOMO effect deteriorates our psychological well-being, making us feel like we are unable to capitalize on what is happening around us. The FOMO effect distorts our perception, and exaggerates the success and happiness of others, thereby inducing feelings of unhappiness, loneliness, and inadequacy. Negative effects of FOMO have recently led over 40 states in the United States to initiate legal proceedings in the federal court against Meta, the parent company overseeing Facebook and Instagram. The lawsuit alleges that the social media corporation had harmful effects on the mental health of young individuals. Andrea Joy Campbell, the Attorney General of Massachusetts, asserted that Meta’s designs “deliberately 6 https ://www .pewresearch .org/fact- tank /2021/06/01/facts- about -americans -and-facebook/  [accessed: 20.06.2023].7 https ://www .pewresearch .org/internet/2022/08/10/teens -social- media -and-technology-2022/ [accessed: 20.06.2023].
	Boyan Ivantchev, Madlen Ivantcheva  70exploited young people’s still developing brains and adolescent vulnerabilities” with features such as the “infinite scroll” , near-constant notifications and alerts, autoplay Stories and Reels, all engineered to instill a fear of missing out (FOMO) and a “slot-machine-type tactic called intermittent variable rewards to keep young people addicted to their app” .8 Its negative impact is also observed in our behaviour in financial markets. Instead of trading and investing based on the specifics of our age, family, health, risk, and wealth profile, and own tactical and strategic goals, the FOMO effect compels us to blindly follow the trends and copy others, which may have entirely different starting profiles, wealth, and objectives. The negative effects of using online social media include a total of 46 effects, one of which is defined as “Increased users’ appetite to take too much financial risk” [Baroon et al., 2021, p. 8]. This effect stems from the dark side of social media (DoSM). It can lead to increased irrationality, more risky behaviour among online traders and investors, and “…encourage frequent trading” [Deloitte, 2021, p. 1]. Therefore, the social media influence, easy-to-use technologies, and nearly no money barriers (fractional investing and trading) are resulting in unrealistic profit expectations, especially for novice traders [Delfabbro et al., 2021], and finally to a loss of savings and family wealth. Due to the a priori inherent limitations of the resources available to us (time and financial resources) and the cognitive capacity to evaluate all the available information, we must opti -mize our decision-making under the environment of bounded rationality. Therefore, under the influence of FOMO, online traders/investors wrongly are trying to optimize choices and maximize the utility by choosing copy trading. Such a choice is leading to increasing our risk appetite and even exposing signal followers to a lottery-like return structure – triggering their gambling behaviour on the financial markets [Oehler, Schneider, 2023].As a result of the current study, we state here that the pernicious effect of FOMO is accel -erated by the omnipresence of social and social-trading networks, facilitating easy and instan -taneous buying and selling of tens of thousands of financial instruments. The information and signals spread in the social and social trading networks “…tends to play an extremely vital role in how they (novice and experienced traders/investors) receive and process information, as well as how they make investment decisions” [Deloitte, 2021, p. 3]. We argue that abundant information disseminated through social and social-trading networks, in many cases, is pre -sented in a specific context and with a particular purpose, thereby amplifying the influence of the FOMO effect. When the disseminated information has a specific manipulative intent, whether deliberate or unintentional, is inaccurate, or entirely false, the decisions made by par -ticipants in social networks are exposed to higher risks and can even have detrimental effects on the outcomes of their decisions [Florendo, Estelami, 2019]. The pernicious influence of the FOMO effect systematically compels us to deviate from rational choices and behave irration -ally, endangering our personal and family wealth, and psychological well-being. Evidence for interrelation between FOMO and regret aversion additionally pushes individuals to rise the 8 https://eu.sj-r.com/story/news/politics/state/2023/10/25/meta-lawsuit-illinois-other-states-claim-company-hurts-kids-teens/71315704007/ [accessed: 26.11.2023].
	FOMO effect: social media and online traders 71weight of relatively inefficient and potentially risky assets in their portfolios [Fabozzi, 2023]. Heretofore by knowing the harmful effects of FOMO, individual and also institutional trad -ers and investors can rethink and readjust their trading and investment approach and avoid gambling behaviour, herd behaviour, and excessive trading.The limitations of the current study are mainly connected with the lack of data sets of copy and non-copy e-traders’ results to confirm which of the two groups is exhibiting excessive trading and risk-taking, and finally to compare their yields. In the future the authors believe they would be able to obtain such data sets from the social trading networks.
