Here is the cleaned-up text of the scientific article:The Role of Fear of Missing Out and Experience in the Formation of SME Decision Makers' Intentions to Adopt New Manufacturing TechnologiesCorporate decision-makers form their intention to adopt new technology for their venture based on their perception of its usefulness and ease of use. However, the formation of this intention might be influenced by the fear of missing out (FOMO), making decision-makers fear losing their relatedness with fellow managers and leading to decisions based on irrational considerations.We draw on and extend the technology acceptance model to explain the potential bias caused by FOMO and expect that this bias is contingent on the level of decision makers' prior experience with the new technology in other contexts. Moderated OLS regressions on 514 observations collected from a representative sample of decision-makers of Austrian SMEs show that FOMO is positively related to the intention to adopt new technology. Moreover, we find that the relationship is mitigated by the decision maker's prior experience with that new technology.We highlight the relevance of the FOMO bias in technology acceptance, adding to the growing research stream on the role of emotions in adopting novel technologies. We further show how experience can effectively counter the FOMO bias for many decision-makers and extend the scope of technology acceptance models by illustrating their applicability to novel manufacturing technologies.1. INTRODUCTIONCorporate decision makers are increasingly faced with the challenge of making decisions on adopting or rejecting new manufacturing technologies in which they have limited experience. Because such decisions strongly impact the further development of the company, they are often exacerbated by social, emotional, and psychological factors.A well-established framework used to capture the intention to adopt new technology is the technology acceptance model (TAM). TAM builds on the principles of the theory of reasoned action and the theory of planned behavior with the basic assumption that individuals act rationally in basing their adoption decisions on a technology's perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use.We expand this stream of research on TAM further. We not only add an additional factor to TAM by introducing the fear of missing out (FOMO) as a bias in managerial decisions on new manufacturing technologies, but also provide a solution by explaining how prior experience with a new technology can reduce the FOMO bias. FOMO can be conceptualized within self-determination theory as the negative emotional state that manifests when individuals perceive their relatedness with their peer group to be threatened.Self-determination theory holds that relatedness is one of three innate psychological needs that determine an individual's psychological well-being. FOMO is pervasive in individuals and leads to irrational behavioral changes as has been shown for areas such as smartphones, the internet, or social media.Received 5 March 2021; Received in revised form 29 March 2022; Accepted 22 April 2022
	Here is the cleaned-up text without unwanted information:We argue that corporate decision makers' fear to lose their relatedness with fellow managers because of not joining the bandwagon towards a new manufacturing technology may motivate them to adopt these technologies in the firm over and above what is warranted based on their rational considerations. We further argue that an individual's experience with a new technology prior to adoption is positively linked to his or her usage intention because managers form habits and routines and feel more comfortable with technologies they already know from other contexts. More importantly, we argue that experience is buffering the positive relationship of FOMO and intention to adopt the new manufacturing technology.To empirically test these arguments, we complement the core TAM variables with the ten items delimiting FOMO suggested by Przybylski et al. (2013) and survey decision makers' experience and intentions to adopt additive manufacturing (AM) -- an emerging manufacturing technology better known as 3D printing. The survey data used derive from 514 observations from a representative sample of decision makers of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Austria.Our moderated OLS regression shows that FOMO is positively related to the intention to adopt a new technology and that the relationship is weakened by the prior experience the decision maker has in relation to that new technology. Subgroup analyses identify the boundaries of our results. While the FOMO bias and experience are relevant across all subgroups, the buffering effect of experience for the FOMO bias applies to the specific subgroups of decision makers who are very open to new technologies, who are well educated (i.e., who have a university degree) and who work in the sectors of craft and industry.Our results contribute to research on TAM in three specific ways. First, we highlight the relevance of the FOMO bias in SME decision makers' individual decisions on implementing a new manufacturing technology in the firm. This insight adds to the growing research stream on the role of emotions in the implementation of novel technologies. Second, we suggest prior experience with the novel technology as an effective measure to counter the FOMO bias for many SME decision makers. This learning links to well-established concepts such as experiential learning by doing for overcoming knowledge barriers for the use of novel technologies. Third, we extend the scope of TAM by highlighting that the FOMO bias is not only relevant for end-users of consumer products and services but also for corporate decision makers in their decision on implementing novel manufacturing technologies.We discuss potential implications and propose an agenda for further research.Theoretical Background and Hypotheses:2.1. Technology AcceptanceWhy do individuals adopt new technologies? This question has long been explored in theory and practice. Among the most popular models analyzing individual adoption intentions and decisions is the TAM, which draws on the theory of reasoned action (Ajzen & Fishbein, 1980; Fishbein & Ajzen, 1975) and the theory of planned behavior (Ajzen, 1991) and investigates the determinants of an individual's intention to adopt new technologies.2.2. The role of FOMOExtensions of the TAM incorporated emotions and psychological states in addition to the rational factors, such as computer anxiety (Venkatesh, 2000) and technology addiction (Turel, Serenko, & Giles, 2011) that can influence the intention to adopt a new technology by affecting perceptions about the use of that technology. One emotion that warrants consideration in the context of technology acceptance is the fear of missing out (FOMO), which describes the "pervasive apprehension that others might be having rewarding experiences from which one is absent" (Przybylski et al., 2013, p. 1841).
	I've removed the unwanted information and extracted the exact text of the original scientific article. Here is the cleaned text:3relatedness with their peer group to be threatened (Elhai et al., 2018). Accordingly, individuals who perceive their relatedness with their peer group at risk experience higher levels of FOMO and, therefore, try to find ways to regulate their psychological well-being (Przybylski et al., 2013). That process of regulating their psychological well-being often entices individuals experiencing higher levels of FOMO to mimic their peers. Individuals are surprisingly willing to change their behavior to regulate their psychological well-being in response to FOMO (Kang, Cui, & Son, 2019). For example, when their peers use smartphones, the internet, or social media, they also use smartphones, the internet, or social media. This effect even makes individuals use technologies excessively when their peers use them extensively (e.g., Abel, Buff, & Burr, 2016; Alt & Boniel-Nissim, 2018; Beyens, Frison, & Eggermont, 2016; Elhai et al., 2018; Przybylski et al., 2013). The FOMO has been shown to impair rational considerations in many different contexts. For example, individuals who fear missing out show more extreme responses and a lack of constructive problem solving when digital technologies fail, suggesting that preventing access to these technologies may cause severe anxiety (Hadlington & Scase, 2018). In the work context, FOMO in employees dislocated from the office due to travel or remote work leads to extensive message checking behavior and constant signaling of commitment in fear of losing the relatedness with their peers up to a degree that causes burnout symptoms and impairs their personal lives (Budnick, Rogers, & Barber, 2020; Cristea & Leonardi, 2019). In the context of risk capital investments, FOMO impacts on project assessments and causes excessive information-seeking behavior (Clor-Proell, Guggenmos, & Rennekamp, 2020) and irrational investment decisions (Carreyrou, 2018). In the marketing context, FOMO increases impulse purchasing (e.g., Good & Hyman, 2020), which in turn leads to post-purchase regrets (e.g., Celik, Eru, & Cop, 2019; Saleh, 2012). The rationale is that a purchase decision is also a decision to belong to a particular peer group and a positive purchase decision is, therefore, motivated by the fear of being excluded from such a group (Kang et al., 2019).The theoretical considerations and empirical evidence suggest that individuals who fear missing out the relatedness to their peers engage in behavior intended to combat this fear (Pentina, Koh, & Le, 2012; Hartwick & Barki, 1994; Ram & Jung, 1991). The effect of FOMO motivating a certain behavior over and above rational considerations can be interpreted as a bias. In face of FOMO, a certain behavior is shown more often or more intensively than would be warranted on rational grounds. This FOMO bias is amplified when the available option (i.e., a market offer, an investment, or a technology) is subject to hype (Angst et al., 2010; Jun, 2012; Swanson, 2012; Tomasino & Fedorowicz, 2014; Wang, 2010; Hayran et al., 2020). Not only novel technologies in consumer products signal the belonging to specific societal peer groups and are subject to hype cycles. Also new manufacturing technologies such as additive manufacturing are subject to communities of corporate decision makers and undergo hype cycles (Shanler & Basiliere, 2019).We argue that corporate decision makers’ fear to lose their relatedness with fellow managers because of not joining the bandwagon towards a new manufacturing technology may motivate them to adopt these technologies over and above what is warranted based on their rational considerations. Based on these arguments we formulate our first hypothesis:H1: FOMO is positively related to the intention to use a new manufacturing technology.The role of experience An individual’s experience with a new technology can positively influence his or her usage intention (Manis & Choi, 2019; Szajna, 1996; Thompson, Higgins, & Howell, 1994) and later adoption (Compagni et al., 2015). Experience benefits individuals making decisions by allowing them to choose the technology with the greatest benefit for them (Dishaw & Strong, 1999). Experience acquired prior to adoption, gained through education or practical experience with the technology in a private context, in a previous occupation or through external service providers allows individuals to acquire information and learn more about the technology’s strengths and weaknesses (Hartwick & Barki, 1994; Gielnik et al., 2015). The level of previous experience with a new manufacturing technology is positively related to the intention to use that new manufacturing technology. Alongside the direct relationship between experience and usage intention, experience can also moderate the relationship between FOMO and usage intention. Knowledge about a novel technology reduces uncertainty in the decision on the implementation of this technology (Ravichandran, 2001). Thus, the more corporate decision makers know about the technology they consider adopting, the less uncertainty they perceive in relation to the decision (Ghadim et al., 1999). They are less uncertain regarding the next steps they need to take in the adoption process (action uncertainty) and regarding the opportunity costs implied by giving up alternative technologies (action doubt). At the same time, they know more about the consequences of the adoption (van Gelderen et al., 2015; McKelvie et al., 2011; McMullen & Shepherd, 2006). The less uncertain decision makers are in their adoption decision, the more important are the rational elements–such as performance indicators of the new technology in question–in comparison to the emotional elements–such as FOMO–in the decision-making process (Simon, 1987; Feldman et al., 1998). The more experience individuals have with a technology, the less their intention to use that technology is driven by FOMO. Thus, experience is buffering the positive relationship of FOMO and the intention to adopt the new manufacturing technology. We therefore propose the following hypothesis:H2: The level of previous experience with a new manufacturing technology is positively related to the intention to use that new manufacturing technology. H3: The level of previous experience with a new manufacturing technology moderates the relationship between FOMO and the intention to use that new manufacturing technology, such that a rising level of experience weakens the relationship.
	Here is the cleaned text of the scientific article, free from unwanted artefacts and information:Technological Forecasting & Social Change4. We extracted a random sample of 7,286 firms from those 52,845 firms that were weighted for firm size (one-third from each size category: micro, small, and medium). Each sampled firm was contacted to identify an interview partner with decision power on the manufacturing technologies used in the firm. In micro and small firms, that contact was likely to be the founder and/or CEO, while in medium-sized firms we welcomed members of the top management team as respondents. Data were collected with computer-aided telephone interviews. To give the firms a similar chance to participate in the survey, we made three contact attempts with each firm, which resulted in 585 responses. The response rate of 8% is a little below average but in line with similar studies that randomly addressed decision makers with detailed questionnaires.We addressed potential nonresponse bias at the survey design stage by carefully designing the questionnaire to maintain the respondent's interest, keeping it to a reasonable length, and establishing the importance of the study in the introductory email. We also assessed the analytic sample for potential nonresponse bias using two techniques, each targeting a specific type of nonresponse. First, we implemented the archival approach, which compares the characteristics of the sample with those of the population. This approach is particularly suitable for identifying passive nonresponse, which results from external factors hindering the recipients from returning the completed questionnaire on time. Passive nonresponse typically accounts for 85% of total nonresponse. For our sample, we used the respondents' age, gender, and education level for archival analysis, as these variables have been shown to influence the intention to use new technologies and because the information was available for the population of Austrian SME decision makers. The comparison identified only a minor under-sampling of women and the education level was slightly higher in the sample than in the relevant population, accordingly, passive nonresponse does not seem to be a major concern. Second, we applied wave analysis to compare the results from early and late respondents, which is especially useful for controlling active nonresponse, which refers to a conscious decision not to participate in a study. For our sample, the wave analysis did not identify any significant differences between early (first half) and late (second half) respondents, and hence we conclude that active nonresponse bias is not an issue in our sample.3.2. Variables3.2.1. Independent variablesWe used validated reflective measurement models to capture the dependent and independent variables. Specifically, in our operationalization, we follow the TAM (Davis, 1989; Davis et al., 1989), which is the most widely applied model used to capture individuals' acceptance and usage of available technologies. The TAM is an information system theory that builds on Fishbein and Ajzen's (1975) theory of reasoned action (TRA), which measures technology acceptance based on two variables, Perceived ease of use and Perceived usefulness. The current study adopts those two variables as its first two independent variables. The first, perceived usefulness, reflects the degree to which a person believes that using a particular technology would enhance their job performance. We measure usefulness using four items with an example being "Using additive manufacturing in my job increases my productivity." The second independent variable, perceived ease of use, reflects the degree to which a person believes that using a particular technology would require little effort. We use four items to measure ease of use with one example being "I find additive manufacturing to be easy to use." We complement the core TAM variables with the fear of missing out (FOMO) as our third independent variable. To measure FOMO, we use the original ten items suggested by Przybylski et al. (2013). A sample item is "It bothers me when I miss an opportunity to meet other people from my industry." For each item, respondents indicated their degree of agreement on a 7-point Likert-style scale anchored with "I do not agree at all" (1) and "I completely agree" (7).3.2.2. Moderator variableIn our theoretical model, we argue that the relationship between FOMO and the intention to use AM is moderated by the level of experience SME decision makers have with AM technology in other contexts prior to adoption in their firm. We operationalize Experience as a three-point categorial variable with high values representing a high level of experience.3.2.3. Dependent variableThe model is set up to explain the intention of SME decision makers to use AM as a new manufacturing technology. In this study, the dependent variable is Intention to use AM (Davis, 1989; Davis et al., 1989). Additive manufacturing is but one example of an archetypal emerging manufacturing technology with intensive media attention and moderate current market value (Maresch & Gartner, 2020). We address the call by Ajzen (Tornikoski & Maalaoui, 2019) that researchers using TPB/TRA should define a temporal frame for an intended behavior by applying a twelve-month outlook. To capture SME decision makers' intention to use AM in their firm, we use a three-item scale; accordingly, a sample item is "I plan to use additive manufacturing in the next 12 months." As with the independent variables, the respondents indicated the extent to which they agreed with statements relating to the dependent variable on a 7-point Likert-style scale anchored with "I do not agree at all" (1) and "I completely agree" (7).3.2.4. Control variablesWe controlled for the respondents' biological age, sex, and education level because these aspects have been shown to influence the intention to use available technology (Venkatesh & Morris, 2000; Venkatesh et al., 2002).3.3. Common Method BiasPrior research highlights the threat of common method bias (CMB) affecting empirical research relying on cross-sectional data (Lindell & Whitney, 2001), and especially for the most common self-report surveys where the dependent and independent variables are cognitions (Harrison, McLaughlin, & Coalter, 1996). Several ex-ante and ex-post measures have been suggested to address the risk of CMB (Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Lee, & Podsakoff, 2003). However, Spector (2006) and Richardson, Simmering, and Sturman (2009) provided compelling evidence showing that ex-post statistical measures used to adjust analyses to account for CMB are unreliable and often misleading, which prompted the use of strategies to avoid CMB ex-ante in this study. First, we protected the respondents' anonymity, thus mitigating evaluation apprehension (Podsakoff et al., 2003). Second, we used different question formats and randomized the order of scales in the questionnaire.3.4. Analysis Strategy and DiagnosticsWe ran a moderated OLS regression using a stepwise approach. In the first step, we entered the control variables in the model. In the second step, we added the three dependent variables, and in the third step, we added the interaction term. In the interpretation of the results, it must be kept in mind that our analysis is based on a cross-sectional dataset, which does not allow for testing causalities but associations. Before performing the final estimations, we examined the model for

Descriptive StatisticsTable I shows the means, minima, maxima, standard deviations, and the correlation matrix for all variables used in the analysis. We do not detect any unexpected correlations.3.6. ResultsTable II presents the results of the OLS regression models. Model 1 includes the control variables alone; Model 2 shows the direct relationships of all variables (the TAM baseline assumptions as well as Hypotheses 1 and 2), and Model 3 adds the interaction term (Hypothesis 3).Model 1 shows that among the control variables biological age and sex are significantly related to the intention of SME decision makers to use AM in the 12 months following the survey. In line with our expectations, young male respondents report stronger intentions to use AM compared to female and older respondents.Model 2 adds all independent variables to the equation. In the baseline assumptions rooted in the TAM, we expected perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use to be positively related to SME decision makers' intention to use AM in the coming 12 months. We find that both perceived usefulness (β=.275; p=.000) and perceived ease of use (β=.267; p=.000) are significantly and positively related to the intention to use AM. This result confirms our baseline assumptions.The first hypothesis expressed an expectation that the fear of missing out (FOMO) would be positively related to SME decision makers' intentions to use AM in the coming 12 months. We find that FOMO is significantly and positively (β=.137; p=.000) related to the intention to use the new technology. This result supports our first hypothesis (H1).The second hypothesis expressed an expectation that the level of experience with the new technology gained prior to adoption would be positively related to SME decision makers' intentions to use that new technology in the coming 12 months. We find that the level of experience is significantly and positively (β=.325; p=.000) related to the intention to use the new technology. This result supports our second hypothesis (H2).Model 3 adds the interaction term. For the parsimony of the presentation, we include only the significant interaction term in the model presented in Table II. The third hypothesis expressed an expectation that the level of experience prior to adoption with the new technology would moderate the relationship between FOMO and SME decision makers' intention to use that new technology in the following 12 months, such that a rise in the level of experience weakens the relationship. We find that the interaction term is significant and has a negative sign (β=-.100; p=.003). To ease interpretation, we plotted the interaction term (Fig. I), which indicated that under the condition of low levels of experience, FOMO among SME decision makers is more strongly linked to the intention to use the new technology than under the condition of a high level of experience. Experience with the new technology therefore has a buffering effect on the relationship between FOMO and the intention to use the technology. This finding supports Hypothesis 3.In addition, to identify the boundaries of our results we perform subgroup analysis for those sectors that were populated with a sufficient number of observations, for different levels of education and of openness to new technologies (Table II). The subgroup analysis reveals that the FOMO bias and experience are relevant across all subgroups. The buffering effect of experience on the FOMO bias, however, applies to the specific subgroups of decision makers who are very open to new technologies, who are well educated (i.e., who have a university degree) and who work in the sectors of craft and industry.4. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONThis study examined decision makers' intentions to adopt a novel manufacturing technology in their SME. Specifically, it theoretically argued and empirically tested the relevance and interplay of the FOMO bias and the decision maker's experience with a novel manufacturing technology acquired prior to adoption for such decisions. We use AM as an example of such a new manufacturing technology. Our theoretical reasoning builds on the TAM.We argue that corporate decision makers fear to lose their relatedness with fellow managers because they fail to join the crowd towards a new manufacturing technology. This FOMO may motivate them to adopt a novel technology that is popular among their peers in their firm, over and above what is warranted based on their rational considerations. Further, we propose that corporate decision makers' intention to adopt a new technology also depends on their experience with this technology prior to adoption (Manis & Choi, 2019; Szajna, 1996; Thompson, Higgins, & Howell, 1994). This is because for a specific application decision makers are likely to make a positive evaluation of a new technology if this technology has proven to be useful and easy to use in other applications in the past. The last step in our argumentation is that decision makers' prior experience with a novel manufacturing technology is buffering the positive relationship between FOMO and intention to adopt it in the firm. We explain the moderation effect with the reduced relevance of emotional factors in less uncertain decisions. Experience implies reduced decision uncertainty, which in turn is associated with reduced relevance of emotional factors in comparison with rational factors in the managerial decision to adopt a new manufacturing technology (Simon, 1987; Feldman et al., 1998). Accordingly, we hypothesized that (1) FOMO is positively related to the intention to use a new manufacturing technology, that (2) the level of prior experience with the new manufacturing technology is positively related to the intention to use that new manufacturing technology, and that (3) the level of prior experience with a new manufacturing technology moderates the relationship between FOMO and the intention to use that new manufacturing technology, in a way that a rise in the level of experience weakens the relationship.Our OLS regression model confirmed our baseline assumptions rooted in the TAM that perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use are positively related to SME decision makers' intention to use novel manufacturing technologies.Table IDescriptive statisticsα Min Max Mean SD1.

	Here is the extracted text with all unwanted information removed:manufacturing technology in their firm. Most importantly, we found FOMO as well as prior experience are positively related to SME decision makers’ intentions to use new technology and that prior experience can buffer the FOMO bias. Interestingly, FOMO bias and experience are relevant across all subgroups. However, the buffering effect of experience for the FOMO bias applies to three specific subgroups of decision makers. These subgroups include decision makers who are very open to new technologies, who have a high level of education (i.e., a university degree), and who work in the sectors craft and industry.The findings show that FOMO pushes SME decision makers towards the implementation of novel manufacturing technology. Thus, even with similar evaluations of the usefulness and ease of use of a novel manufacturing technology, when SME decision makers have high levels of FOMO, they also have stronger intentions to adopt this novel manufacturing technology. FOMO seems to be an extrafunctional attribute of the novel technology as a positive decision to implement the novel manufacturing technology adds emotional value to managers over and above the rational arguments based on functional attributes.The FOMO bias identified in this study confirms recent findings by Schillebeeckx et al (2022) on how managers choose novel materials for manufacturing technology choices. It helps explain managerial investment decisions in new technologies that–from a rational point of view –were made too early or based on too weak rationales. However, it is important to note that a bias towards the adoption of new manufacturing technologies does not imply disadvantageous management decisions. It rather means that rational arguments (not yet) warrant such a managerial decision.Our results also provide an effective measure for mitigating the potential threat of FOMO bias. Rising levels of prior experience with a new manufacturing technology buffer the FOMO bias in SME decision makers. However, subgroup analyses have revealed important boundary conditions for this buffering effect. First, the buffering effect shows among SME decision makers who are very open to new technologies. A lack of openness to new technologies apparently blocks experienced-based learning (Adler and Clark, 1991) that would reduce uncertainty and, thus, the relevance of emotional factors such as FOMO in the decision to implement the novel technology.Formal education seems to enable experienced-based learning in SME decision makers. We find the buffering effect of prior experience with a novel manufacturing technology on the FOMO bias among those SME decision makers in our sample who hold a university degree. Finally, prior experience with a novel manufacturing technology is only an effective measure to counter the FOMO bias for SME decision makers who work in the sectors craft and industry but not for those who work in service & trade.Table II: Test of Hypotheses and robustness checksNote: This table is removed as it appears to be a statistical analysis table with multiple variables and coefficients, which is not relevant to the main text.
	Here is the extracted text without unwanted information and artefacts:manufacturing technologies.Our insights must be interpreted against the backdrop of the limitations of the data used, the analytical strategy followed, and the theoretical background we built upon. Our sample is limited to Austrian SMEs and AM technology. However, Austria offers a good example of a well-developed industrial country with a population of firms that face the constant challenge of keeping up with technological change. AM is a prominent example of an emerging technology that is relevant to almost all industries. To better understand the boundary conditions of our findings, future research should also target other geographical regions and research different technologies and sectors. Moreover, while the scales in our survey instrument employed were designed carefully, social desirability bias and nonresponse bias cannot be completely ruled out.Although the TAM (e.g., Davis, 1989; Venkatesh et al., 2002) offers a valuable theoretical lens, future research could also investigate the institutional context in which firms’ adoption of technologies takes place, using different theoretical frameworks such as the Diffusion of Innovation Theory (Moore & Benbasat, 1991; Rogers, 2003). This study only takes an individual-level perspective, which would benefit from being expanded to the market- and organizational-level in future studies to capture cross-level effects.Notwithstanding the limitations, our findings contribute to research on TAM in three specific ways. First, we highlight the relevance of the FOMO bias in SME decision makers’ individual decisions on implementing a new manufacturing technology in the firm. This insight adds to the growing research stream on the role of emotions in the implementation of novel technologies. Second, we suggest prior experience with the novel technology as an effective measure to counter the FOMO bias for many SME decision makers. This learning links to well-established concepts such as experiential learning by doing for overcoming knowledge barriers for the use of novel technologies.Third, we extend the scope of TAM by highlighting that the FOMO bias is not only relevant for end-users of consumer products and services but also for corporate decision makers in their decision on implementing novel manufacturing technologies. The successful application of TAM to a manufacturing technology illustrates the model’s value for studying technologies well beyond its traditional applications in studies on consumer technologies or commercial technologies.The study contributes to practice by stressing the relevance of the FOMO bias in SME decision makers’ intentions to adopt novel manufacturing technologies. As the FOMO bias constitutes both a potential opportunity and a potential threat to the SME decision makers’ choice to implement a novel manufacturing technology in the firm, it is important that decision makers are aware of this phenomenon.We identified specific subgroups who can mitigate the FOMO bias by acquiring experience with the envisaged manufacturing technology outside the firm prior to making the adoption decision. While we cannot predict the quality of the resulting managerial decision, we could show that for well-educated SME decision makers who are concerned with manufacturing and very open to new technologies, with rising levels of prior experience with the envisaged manufacturing technology, rational factors matter more, and emotional factors matter less for SME decision makers’ intention to implement this technology in the firm. These decision makers should consider investing in knowledge first and in technology second.Policymakers can build on our findings by providing corporate decision makers located in the region with low threshold access to new technologies to build up their experience at low risk. Such support, for example, could entail a public-sector agency managing specific public-private partnerships between companies and universities focusing on emerging technologies. These partnerships could include technology platforms on a corporate level or makerspaces on an individual level. The focus of such initiatives could be on the subgroups identified as sensitive to the buffering effect of prior experience on the FOMO bias.The initiatives could advance the dissemination of unbiased knowledge and offer decision makers first-hand experience of emerging technologies for experimental learning. Successful examples in the area of AM are for instance the public-private partnership “America Makes” and the “fabfoundation”.
	Here is the text without unwanted information:Future research could build on our findings and examine the impact of FOMO on technologies that are subject to technology hypes to study structural biases affecting technologies that could arise from market and media dynamics. Another interesting aspect would be an investigation of marketing and public relation activities to examine the extent to which FOMO is consciously or unconsciously created or promoted by firms offering new technologies to the market. In addition, our research approach could be extended to other stakeholders such as politicians, funding agencies, and investors to investigate whether FOMO and experience (or the lack thereof) bias their engagement with new technologies. Finally, a follow-up study examining whether the buffering effect of prior experience on the FOMO bias found in this study also affects technology use in areas from which the original FOMO research originates —that of smartphones, the internet, and social media —would also be welcome.The study concludes that emotions can bias intentions to adopt new technologies and, thus, subsequent decisions. FOMO among decision makers in SMEs seems to be no exception. This research should encourage SME decision makers to first decide on how much to invest in becoming familiar with a new technology and acquiring experience in its use before deciding whether to adopt that technology in the firm. Decision makers acting on this insight are aware of the FOMO bias in their technology adoption decisions and, thus, expedite the development of their SME in times of ongoing technological transformation.

	Here is the extracted text without unwanted information:The results of her work have been published both in scholarly journals such as Technological Forecasting and Social Change, Journal of Corporate Finance, and Entrepreneurship and Regional Development, as well as in transfer publications such as the European Central Bank Working Paper Series. Her research has attracted funding from institutions such as the EU and the Swedish Kamprad Family Foundation for Entrepreneurship, Research & Charity as well as private enterprises.Here is the text of the original scientific article, without unwanted information and artefacts:The psychology of cryptocurrency trading: Risk and protective factorsBackground and aims: Crypto-currency trading is a rapidly growing form of behaviour characterised by investing in highly volatile digital assets based largely on blockchain technology. In this paper, we review the particular structural characteristics of this activity and its potential to give rise to excessive or harmful behaviour including over-spending and compulsive checking. We note that there are some similarities between online sports betting and day trading, but also several important differences. These include the continuous 24-hour availability of trading, the global nature of the market, and the strong role of social media, social influence and non-balance sheet related events as determinants of price movements.Methods: We review the specific psychological mechanisms that we propose to be particular risk factors for excessive crypto trading, including: over-estimations of the role of knowledge or skill, the fear of missing out (FOMO), preoccupation, and anticipated regret. The paper examines potential protective and educational strategies that might be used to prevent harm to inexperienced investors when this new activity expands to attract a greater percentage of retail or community investors.Discussion and conclusions: The paper suggests the need for more specific research into the psychological effects of regular trading, individual differences and the nature of decision-making that protects people from harm, while allowing them to benefit from developments in blockchain technology and crypto-currency.KEYWORDS: crypto-currency, trading, harm, risk factors, protective factorsINTRODUCTION: THE NATURE OF CRYPTOCURRENCYCryptocurrency trading appears to be one of the fastest growing markets in the world. Surveys conducted by major exchanges suggest that hundreds of thousands of people are signing up to exchange platforms each month. The current global population of crypto-currency buyers and sellers is now estimated to be over 106 million. So rapidly is this growth occurring that figures reported as recently as three months ago are already significant under-estimates. Growth in retail investors (from the general population) is paralleled by growth in the cryptocurrency market itself. Total market capitalisation has now reached 1.75 trillion $US in February 2021 after having been $550 billion in December 2020 and $275 billion in June 2020. The price of Bitcoin (BTC), the leading currency, has increased in price from $9,500 (June 2020) to a peak of $58,000 in February 2021, with similar exponential growth observed in Ethereum (ETH) and numerous other ‘altcoins’. This growth in cryptocurrency value, increasing investor interest and media attention has raised some media commentary about whether the general community might be fully aware of the risks or harms that might be associated with this activity. This is particularly when media activity may focus primarily on a small minority of early investors who have achieved financial gains, largely due to investing at the bottom of the market.
	Here is the cleaned-up text of the scientific article:The term cryptocurrency refers to digital ‘coins’ or assets that are based on block-chain technology. Blockchains are distributed ledger systems where each node of the system is linked together in a peer-to-peer network. All transactions are systematically validated by each component of the network. Blocks, which form the basis for the coins, are created through an initial coin release (or ICO), can be earned through activities (e.g., in gaming, transaction activity), or “mined”. Mining usually occurs through ‘proof-of-work’ systems, whereby cryptographic algorithms generate complex random numbers of hashes which must be solved using the application of computer power.Coins are traded on exchanges, stored privately in wallets using “keys” or identifiers. Increasingly, they can be used in tokenised economies to pay for games, to gamble, to pay for commodities, for producing work (e.g., Anytask and Electroneum) or secure contracts (smart contracts, Chainlink) and to coordinate supply chains (e.g., VeChain) or as currency (Reserve Rights or BTC).Cryptocurrency trading has much in common with modern trading on the share-market. It attracts both experienced and less experienced investors; both large institutional investors as well as small retail investors; is subject to market fluctuations; and, trading is heavily automated, with buy and sell orders set by digital trading systems. However, there are a number of clear differences. Trading can occur 24 hours of the day and every day of the week. Second, crypto coins are harder to value. In contrast to mining companies that can state potential earnings (e.g., based on gold deposits or barrels of oil), this is more difficult with cryptocurrencies which share many similarities with stocks traded on venture exchanges.Instead, future value can only be based on whether investors believe that the coin will attract attention based on whether it has a good reputation and profile, or whether it has a genuine ‘use case’ (i.e., utility beyond trading). Investors can only look at simple ratios such as the maximum number of coins available vs current supply or the current total market capitalisation as the basis for hypothetical growth. This is based on the knowledge that some coins have a limited maximum and greater likelihood of price growth, whereas others with an infinite supply (e.g., DOGE coin) are in inflationary and lose value as more coins are produced.A third difference is that the crypto market is much more volatile. Prices for single coins can increase over 100% in a matter of hours and then drop back down again soon after. Even Bitcoin, the dominant coin, can vary substantially in price. Markets also move in rapid cycles of boom and bust that are more severe than observed in the standard stock-market. For example, even in well-documented ‘bull-runs’ (e.g., in 2017), the Bitcoin price suffered multiple corrections of between 30 and 40%. Meanwhile, altcoins often display even more extreme price movements.A fourth difference is that crypto trading has the potential create some additional uncertainties that traditional shares often do not create. Many thousands of coins have been produced and many have been scams, whereby coin values have been quickly “pumped” (i.e., artificially inflated in value through means of spreading misinformation) only for the founders to leave the market. Crypto can also be used in criminal activities; be the basis of operations with spurious business propositions; and often be subject to inconsistent or “knee-jerk” regulations (e.g., countries might decide to delist certain coins or ban crypto completely such as currently been suggested in India and Nigeria). Crypto owners can also lose their assets (the keys to their coins) through loss of hard wallets, hard-drives, or other means.
	Here is the cleaned text of the scientific article:Crypto Trading: A Form of Gambling?Crypto trading has many characteristics that make it risky. One characteristic is the high level of volatility, which can result in sudden and significant changes in the value of cryptocurrencies. This volatility can be caused by a variety of factors, including hacks launched on exchanges, or incorrect use of the technology.Another characteristic of crypto trading is that it is very difficult to engage in portfolio balancing to protect against risk on the downside. In conventional share trading, investors can purchase more stable "blue chip" shares which tend to hold their value over a longer period. However, the value of altcoins is pegged to Bitcoin, such that they usually only go up or down when the value of Bitcoin changes. As a result, if Bitcoin suffers a major correction, the value of altcoins will usually be even greater, so that coin holders will have little means of creating a "balanced portfolio" where there may be some hope that some coins will move against the overall market trajectory.These many characteristics of crypto trading have led some commentators to suggest that this new activity shares much in common with online gambling. Indeed, similar arguments have been raised in relation to the day-trading of shares, which appears to entail a significant element of luck or chance, inconsistent returns, and a likelihood of poor returns for most investors.Research by Arthur and Delfabbro (2016) showed that people who gamble are significantly more likely to engage in day-trading. Similar findings have emerged in relation to crypto trading, with Mills and Nower (2019) observing that those who engaged in sports betting and high-risk stock trading were more likely to report crypto-trading. All of these activities were associated with a higher risk of problem gambling, with problem gambling found to be an independent predictor of crypto-trading after controlling for other associated variables.The authors argued that crypto-trading may be appealing to people who enjoy gambling and may attract similar demographic groups or (often younger males with higher levels of income and education) and people with similar personality or temperament, including greater impulsivity and novelty seeking.These emerging findings and the structural characteristics described above therefore raise important questions about the potential risks inherent in crypto-trading. According to our paper, we examine how some of the specific structural characteristics of this new activity might assist in understanding how the topic might need to be approached in psychological research.Risk Factors in Crypto Currency TradingThe illusion of control. Crypto trading, as with day-trading and sports betting, is not entirely based on chance. Skill and strategy can make a difference to outcomes. However, all of these activities offer many opportunities for people to over-estimate the role that applying specific types of knowledge or skill might play in outcomes and, conversely, the significant role that luck and chance are likely to play.The illusion of control, defined as a subjective over-estimation of the objective ability to exert control, is known to be a common feature of gambling. People believe that strategies, skills, or certain rituals can increase the probability of winning. Such beliefs are known to be present in both chance and more skilled games and appear to be stronger in people experiencing gambling problems.Accordingly, in this paper, we outline some of the most important psychological principles that we believe to be central to understanding the potentially addictive elements of this new behavior. We then conclude the paper with discussion of some potential protective factors that could mitigate against the primary risk factors.
	Here is the cleaned-up text of the scientific article, removing all unwanted information and artefacts:The illusion of control is likely to be a strong feature of crypto trading and this feature is also likely to be common to sports betting and day trading. The effect is likely to be bolstered by other heuristics and biases, including biased or self-serving attributions (outcomes due to personal action rather than external factors); hindsight bias (the outcome is seen as being hypothesised all along); and, the hot-hand fallacy (perceptions of predictable momentum shifts or winning periods). Many of these effects are likely to be strong during favourable market conditions.If BTC is trending upwards, then nearly all coins will experience growth over time. As a result, traders will rarely be wrong in their choices and most decisions will be positively reinforced. Traders will therefore, often falsely, infer contingency between their actions and positive outcomes, an effect which is known to be stronger when the probability of reinforcement is high.Social learning and reinforcement. Crypto trading has also emerged during the era of social media. This has led to the emergence of a strong social media culture of crypto advisors, spruikers/influencers and more experienced advisors on platforms such as YouTube. Searching online quickly shows that it is possible to find at least one positive endorsement of at least one major coin. Some of these arise from what appear to be more experienced and well-informed sources, but there are many others that are entirely speculative, ill-informed, and potentially misleading because they leave out key information.Preoccupation. Preoccupation or salience is a recognised feature of most major conceptual models of addiction. Those who engage excessively in a particular activity often find it difficult to disengage from the activity. They may continuously think about the activity (preoccupation) and prioritise the activity ahead of other important responsibilities. Crypto trading would appear to be an activity that has the potential to be highly absorbing.Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) One of the strongest psychological factors that appears to influence crypto-trading is the fear of missing out (FOMO). This term is often used by some experienced traders and a style of thinking to avoid. Although FOMO is likely to be a feature of online sports betting, the opportunities for FOMO seem particularly intensified in crypto-trading.
	I removed all unwanted information and gave you the exact text of the original scientific article. Here it is:Selling because of discussion of even greater potential profits on social media communities. Even when the coin was falling in value, some almost felt obliged to keep the faith and not sell out, even though this would have been in their individual best interest to take even a 50% or 30% profit when the coin's value fell rapidly.Anticipated regretCognitive psychology has recognised for some time that many decisions are based on the desire to minimise anticipated regret (Miller & Taylor, 1995; Schwartz et al., 2002). One of the central findings in this area is that acts of commission (doing something) usually led to stronger feelings of regret than acts of omission (not doing something). This asymmetry has been used to explain why people are reluctant to sell shares which they have held for some time, why they avoid hitting on 16 in blackjack (Miller & Taylor, 1995), and why people will value lottery tickets held for a long time as being more valuable than those held for a shorter period (Bar-Hillel & Neter, 1995; van den Ven & Zeelenberg, 2011). Acts of commission involving regret in trading would include decisions where a stock or coin holding is sold, only for it to rapidly appreciate in value. Acts of omission involve situations where ultimately successful stocks or coins were forgone (not purchased) for other investment decisions.It is clear that both acts are likely to cause significant regret in trading and that this may potentially be a risk factor that is more strongly observed in this activity than in most forms of gambling, with the exception of wagering. In the gambling context, perhaps the most regretful event that might be imagined would be a failure to buy (or to lose) a lottery ticket in a particular week when the winning numbers came up. Most other gaming activities, including the higher risk ones (e.g., gaming machines, card games) are less likely to involve situations where a person might consider themselves to blame for missing out on a win. A reason for this is that the games are usually of a short duration, and decisions made in one game have no bearing on outcomes of future games. By contrast, crypto trading allows traders to observe the folly of their decisions over a long period of time: what they missed out on (a coin that has 100x in value in 6 months), and what coins they sold too early. For this reason, the act of commission and omission effects are both likely to be very strong. However, importantly, given the very strong FOMO effects often described as being the downfall of less experienced investors (who buy into upwards trends), a question arises as to whether the asymmetry between commission vs. omission based regret observed in other contexts is as strongly observed in crypto trading.Protective factors and strategiesAs the popularity of crypto trading rapidly increases over the next 12 months, it is important to identify what psychological and other strategies might be used to mitigate against the risks inherent in this new activity. How can it be kept enjoyable, potentially productive without reducing a person's quality of life? General strategies for avoiding harm associated with excessive trading share some similarities with gambling: sticking to a budget; not spending more than can be afforded; and not chasing losses (losses are, in fact, usually a useful tax offset; e.g., see ‘cryptocurrency as an investment’; www.ato.gov.au). Similarly, it is possible to dispel some of the erroneous beliefs associated with the activity, including the degree to which outcomes can be predicted or controlled. Specifically, to temper over-estimated perceptions of control, new investors need to be aware that crypto value is highly correlated with BTC, so that it is unlikely that altcoins will rise unless BTC is rising as well. In effect, even coins based on high-quality projects with good fundamental use cases may not rise unless BTC is stable and investors are confident about the overall health of the market. This means that protection against downside risk is almost more challenging than for conventional share trading. The best a person can do is to take profits at appropriate times, maintain some liquidity (e.g., convert currencies into USD stable coins) and focus on investments in projects that are likely to have greatest longevity.Protection against social influences is also important. Many YouTube channels and social media opinion (e.g., on Reddit) often involve preaching to a converted audience. Evidence is posted in support of certain coin purchases, but often without any fundamental analysis, critical evaluation of downsides, or consideration of opportunity cost (are there better purchases that might be made). Such information may be circulated rapidly and may even be exploited by bad actors using bots or other means to amplify certain messages to encourage buying coins to manipulate the market. Community education around the need to seek out reputable and multiple information sources, including the appropriate magnitude of investment, may therefore be important in the near future. Inexperienced investors may also need to be taught about the history or longer-time horizons for this market. Many panicked in response to negative news (e.g., the May 2021 Tweets from Tesla CEO, Elon Musk about divesting from Bitcoin payments) even though this would have had negligible impact on the market.Preoccupation or salience is a difficult issue to address if a person is a professional trader and needs to study price movements throughout the day. However, for community general retail investors, it is important to recognise that continual monitoring can be an easy habit to develop even among casual investors. This may begin as a temptation to check that becomes an unconscious or automatic tendency to study price movements during work, during social activities, education, and even during the night. This activity can disrupt sleep, productivity, and be an ongoing distraction. In this way, crypto trading has the potential to combine the financially speculative elements of gambling with social media (e.g., Facebook update checking). Strategies for dealing with this temptation might involve setting limits or rules on when, or how often, the prices are checked. Other activities might be scheduled ahead of price monitoring, so that checking prices only occurs as a type of reward for completing other work.
	Here is the text without unwanted information and artefacts:The principal harm associated with FOMO and regret is that people may impulsively place more money than they can afford on risky coins that have already undertaken rapid growth. As a result, they face a greater risk of buying into the market when it is due for a major correction (historically this occurs when the BTC dominance or % of total market cap is lower). Important advice that can reduce this effect is to encourage satisficing in which people are discouraged from expecting optimal or perfect decision-making. Even experienced traders will not always buy at the lowest price or sell at the highest price. Nor will they pick up every coin that displays very high growth. Instead, the aim is to encourage protective strategies: buy before things are too high; buy the dips or corrections to minimise downside risk; and, stay focused on the positive outcomes rather than the outcomes that were missed.Achievement of at least some very good outcomes in a rising market is likely to be increased if the portfolio is spread over a wider range of coins, but, as mentioned, cannot protect against sudden downturns in the BTC price.Crypto trading is a rapidly growing activity that is likely to receive increasing mainstream acceptance over the next few years. We believe that the topic is important in behavioral addiction research for two reasons. The first is because it brings together elements of risk inherent in gambling, but also in excessive social media use. Particular features that make this form of speculation unique include its 24-hour availability, long-form nature, the extreme volatility of outcomes, and the strong influence of sentiment and social influence. In this sense, it has the potential to be riskier for inexperienced traders whose engagement in the market has been strongly influenced by media attention or FOMO sentiments. A second issue is that crypto trading provides many opportunities to examine the operation of many established principles of social and cognitive psychology. Opportunities exist to profile the distinct risk factors that differentiate crypto trading from other similar activities (day trading and online sports wagering), but also to identify protective factors that can avoid the development of the various harms that might arise when large numbers of inexperienced investors enter the market. Research programs examining these factors are likely to be influential to discussions of consumer protections and inform potential steps for regulation of trading platforms and other activities that involve cryptocurrencies.

Investors’ dynamic hedging demand coincides with covariance risk, which in turn plays a central role in explaining contemporaneous time-variation in expected market returns. Our model predictions are consistent with variations in expected equity and bond returns that include flight-to-quality and fear-of-missing-out episodes, both of which coincide with low levels of equity-bond covariance. We identify determinants of time-variation in conditional covariance and thus potential drivers of flight-to-quality and fear-of-missing-out. Unanticipated changes in expected inflation, market illiquidity and stock market uncertainty predict changes in the equity-bond covariance, where the contribution of each variable is state-dependent. In particular, the non-linear effects of shocks to inflation act as a key driver.1. IntroductionThe crucial role of covariance risk in the pricing of assets can be motivated by the intertemporal capital asset pricing model (ICAPM) of Merton (1973). Reflecting investors’ demand to hedge against adverse changes in the investment opportunity set, the model implies that expected asset returns depend not only on conditional variance but also on conditional covariance with state variables that are linked to time-varying investment opportunities. We propose a bivariate asset pricing model where time-varying investment opportunities are mirrored by time-variation in the conditional covariance between equities and long-term government bonds. From a dynamic hedging perspective, this is intuitive. Given time-variation in conditional equity-bond covariance, which is due to differential exposures of equities and bonds to shocks that correlate with marginal utility of wealth, multi-period investors face dynamic hedging opportunities that matter for portfolio choice.We would like to thank Jonathan Batten, Thorsten Hens, Andrew Karolyi, Harald Kinateder, Gunter Löfler, Matthias Muck, Bernhard Nietert, Klaus Röder, Christian Schlag, Tyler Shumway, Erik Theissen, Jochen Wilhelm as well as participants at the 25th Annual Meeting of the German Finance Association, 8th Annual Financial Market Liquidity Conference, 20th Finanzwerkstatt in Passau, 15th HVB-Unicredit Seminar and at the Centre for Contemporary Australasian Business and Economic Studies, University of Wollongong, for helpful discussions on earlier drafts of the paper. We especially appreciate the comments and suggestions of Juan Francisco Rubio-Ramirez (the editor) and an anonymous referee, which have greatly contributed to improve the article. All remaining omissions and errors are the authors’ sole responsibility.
	Here is the cleaned text of the scientific article, removing all unwanted information and artefacts:Changes in conditional covariance that are related to the dynamics of investors' hedging opportunities thus represent covariance risk that affects asset premia and hence expected returns.The present paper aims to answer the intriguing question whether equity-bond covariance risk is jointly priced in stock and bond markets, and if so, what are the determinants that influence covariance risk? We propose a bivariate conditional pricing model that simultaneously relates expected equity and bond market returns to the variance risk component as well as to the equity-bond covariance risk component. Our study employs monthly U.S. market observations during January 1965 and December 2017 to capture dynamics in conditional market variance and covariance between equity and bond market returns. Model estimation results provide significant evidence that covariance risk is priced in both markets. Further, we can show that the proposed equity-bond pricing relationship is consistent with two important phenomena that are both observed under low levels of equity-bond covariance.We identify and characterize fear-of-missing-out episodes by the following criteria. First, they coincide with low equity market volatility and above-average equity market returns. Second, they are accompanied by a contemporaneous price depression in the bond market and a negative equity-bond covariance. In contrast to flight-to-quality, fear-of-missing-out is characterized by evident flows of funds from bonds to equities rather than from equities to bonds. The fear-of-missing-out pressure leads investors to demand lower premia and hence, to accept lower expected returns on equities.We further focus on the economic determinants that explain time-variation in equity-bond covariance and thus are potential drivers of flight-to-quality and fear-of-missing-out effects. Guidolin and Timmermann (2006) and Guidolin and Timmermann (2007), respectively, provide reliable evidence that linear models are not able to capture time-variation in the conditional moments of equity and bond returns. To account for regime-switching dynamics, we use a threshold vector autoregressive (TVAR) model in order to assess the determinants that are likely to affect equity-bond covariance. The TVAR setting comprises shocks to stock market illiquidity, shocks to bond market illiquidity, and shocks to inflation as endogenous variables and allows to estimate parameters depending on threshold regimes of expected inflation.Estimating the model shows that shocks to inflation are likely to induce changes in equity-bond covariance. This can be related to the proxy hypothesis of Fama (1981) which states that inflation is closely tied to real economic activity and consequently, shocks to inflation may act as a signal for future growth. More recently, David and Veronesi (2013) and Dergunov et al. (2016) claim that inflation shocks can be either good or bad news regarding real growth expectations. Our results show that inflation shocks in fact can represent a positive or negative signal for future economic activity depending on the level of expected inflation.The observed asymmetric signaling effect directly affects equity-bond covariance. During periods of high expected inflation, a positive shock to inflation represents bad news for both markets and reduces expected equity as well as bond returns, thereby it induces an increase in the covariance of the asset returns. During periods of low inflation, positive shocks to inflation act as a signal for improved business conditions representing good news for the equity market. At the same time, positive shocks to inflation are bad news for the bond market and depress nominal bond returns. The differential response of the equity and the bond market tends to result in a reduced level of conditional equity-bond covariance. These findings overall underline the signaling role of inflation shocks which plays a major role for equity and bond markets and makes inflation to a key macroeconomic fundamental in explaining joint dynamics in equity and bond markets and thus, time-variations in equity-bond covariance.
	Here is the cleaned-up text without unwanted information:The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the conditional pricing model and implications for expected equity and bond returns. Section 3 motivates variables that are likely to affect equity-bond covariance and describes the variable construction. Section 4 presents the empirical setting to identify variables that induce time-variation in equity-bond covariance. Section 5 presents the results regarding equity-bond covariance risk pricing and illustrates implications of the equity-bond pricing relations across flight-to-quality and fear-of-missing-out episodes. This section further identifies empirical determinants of time-variation in equity-bond covariance and thus, potential drivers of flight-to-quality and fear-of-missing-out effects. Section 7 concludes.2. Pricing equity-bond covariance riskWe can express the price P of asset i at time t by P i,t = E t [ m t+1 X i,t+1 ] with m t+1 = βu ′ (c t+1 ) u ′ (c t ) , (2.1)where E t ( ·) is the expectation operator conditional on information at time t, m t+1 represents the stochastic discount factor (SDF) and X i,t+1 is the payoff of asset i at time t + 1, c t denotes consumption at time t, and β is the subjective discount factor.The asset’s payoff can be divided into two distinct components, the future price component and the cash flow stream.Assuming that there exists a state variable, z t, that contains information about the conditional distribution of asset returns and thus delivers information about future investment opportunities, the indirect utility of a representative investor also called value function, V (·), depends not only on wealth, W t, but also on the state variable z t. In this case, the maximized value of expected utility in time t of the representative investor is,V (W t, z t) = max { c t, c t+1, ..., w t, w t+1, ... } [ E t ∞ ∑ j=0 βj u ( c t+ j ) ] , (2.2)s.t. W t+1 = r W t+1 (W t - c t ) , r W t = w ′ t r t , w ′ t 1 = 1 ,where r W t is the return on the wealth portfolio at time t, w t is the vector of portfolio weights at time t, and r t is the vector of asset returns at time t. Dynamic programming reduces the infinite period problem into a two-period problem,V (W t, z t) = max { c t, w t } [ u (c t ) + βE t [ max { c t, c t+1, ..., w t, w t+1, ... } E t+1 ∞ ∑ j=0 βj u (c t+1+ j ) ] ] , (2.3)or alternatively,V (W t, z t) = max { c t, w t } E t [ u (c t ) + βE t V (W t+1, z t+1 ) ] . (2.4)At the optimum, the envelope condition, u ′ (c t ) = V W (W t, z t ) , holds for the SDF:m t+1 = βV W (W t+1, z t+1 ) V W (W t, z t ) . (2.5)Eq. (2.5) shows that the SDF depends on the state variable z t and can be expressed as /Lambda1t = e −δt V W (W t, z t ) in continuous-time. The derivative yieldsd/Lambda1t /Lambda1t = −δd t + W t V W W (W t, z t ) V W (W t, z t ) d W t W t + V W z (W t, z t ) V W (W t, z t ) d z t , (2.6)which is the characterization of Merton’s ICAPM in a continuous-time framework. The ICAPM equilibrium relation between the expected market return and market risk can be represented in a simplified form byμM = λM σ2 M + λH σH , (2.7)where λM = −W V W W (W t, z t ) /V W (W t, z t ) is commonly called the coefficient of relative risk aversion. The variance of the market return is denoted by σ2 M and the covariance between the market return and the state variable z t is denoted by σH. The coefficient λH is the price of covariance risk associated with state variable z t. Hence, if state variable z t changes stochastically over time, the investor faces additional risk due to changes in the future investment opportunity set. The risk of an asset is then decomposed into two different constituent risk parts: (i) Risk with respect to the market portfolio and (ii) risk with respect to the hedging portfolio. The expected returns of assets are related to their exposures to these two systematic risks and the associated risk premia.We assume that long-term government bond returns provide a state variable and act as a second risk-factor. The representative investor then holds two funds, namely the equity portfolio and the bond hedging portfolio.
	I have removed all unwanted information from the text, including line numbers, authors' list, information about the editor or references list. Here is the exact text of the original scientific article:The following bivariate pricing relation:E(t)(rM,t+1) = λMσ2M,t+1 + λH,StockσH,t+1,E(t)(rB,t+1) = λBσ2B,t+1 + λH,BondσH,t+1.Here, rM,t+1 denotes the equity market return at time t+1 and rB,t+1 denotes the bond market return at time t+1, σ2M,t+1 and σ2B,t+1 denote conditional equity and bond market variance, and λM and λB are the corresponding market prices of risk for equities and bonds, respectively. Equity-bond conditional covariance is represented by σH,t+1. The coefficient λH is the market price of equity-bond covariance risk.Model (2.8) has several implications for representative investors with constant relative risk aversion. Risk aversion implies that λM > 0 and λB > 0, i.e. investors require a reward for bearing (positive) variance risk. The economic interpretation of λH is more involved and depends on the (positive or negative) level of conditional covariance between equity and bond returns. In general, investors demand a premium for bearing intertemporal risk and stochastic investment opportunities as captured by time-variation in the equity-bond covariance. In sum, the resulting total risk premia in (2.8) may turn low or even negative if the covariance risk component, i.e. the hedging component, dominates. For example, if bonds (equities) provide a hedge against changes in the future investment opportunity set (particularly if σH,t+1 < 0), equity (bond) investors might be even willing to pay a premium for holding the hedging asset and for the reduction of risk regarding lifetime wealth.The price for the hedging opportunities is captured by the second term (the hedging component) in our model, i.e. the part of the expected return investors are willing to give up in order to hedge their portfolio against adverse changes in the investment opportunity set. Vice versa, investors are exposed to the risk of increasing conditional equity-bond covariance and depressed hedging opportunities. Following these logics, the second term of the model reflects the part of the expected return investors demand to compensate for the risk of deteriorated hedging opportunities induced by time-variations in conditional equity-bond covariance.Determinants of equity-bond covariance riskThe potential determinants of equity-bond covariance risk can be motivated by recalling the fundamental asset pricing relation in Eq. (2.1). Equity and bond prices are the discounted sum of all future cash flows, and thus, any variable that either affects the assets' payoff or the discount factor drives equity and bond returns and determines their covariance (Baele et al., 2010). In particular, a variable that affects the cash flow of either equities or bonds is likely to move the assets in opposite directions while a variable that affects only the discount factor is likely to move equities and bonds in the same direction. However, as most variables are supposed to affect cash flow and discount factor simultaneously, it is a hard task to theoretically derive the actual effect on equity-bond covariance.This section motivates a set of factors that are likely to affect the assets' covariance and presents the construction and data source of each economic variable under consideration.InflationEquities and bonds have unique characteristics linked to their differences in the payoff structure. Stocks receive a stochastic dividend income flow, while bonds receive fixed nominal cash flows. It is rather obvious that inflation expectations impact nominal government bond returns. If expected inflation is high, bond investors demand a higher yield that compensates for alleviating the purchasing power of a bond's future cash flows. This is captured by the Fisher decomposition where the nominal bond yield is decomposed into a real interest rate component and a compensation for expected inflation. If inflation is assumed to be stochastic, an inflation risk premium rewards for inflation uncertainty. On the contrary, equities are considered as claims against real assets and should theoretically be unaffected by inflation. However, there is empirical evidence that inflation significantly affects common stocks. Pioneering empirical work of Fama and Schwert (1977) already suggests a negative relation between stock returns and inflation. The empirical evidence is still valid. Also recent studies on the inflation risk premium such as Bekaert and Wang (2010) underline that stocks act as a poor hedge against inflation risk.We decompose the inflation rate into its expected and unexpected part by˜πt = E(πt | Ft−1) + πUt,where E(πt | Ft−1) is the expected inflation rate from time t−1 to t and the disturbance term represents the unexpected component of inflation, πUt. As the inflation rate is approximately a random walk plus serially uncorrelated noise, by definition, the unexpected component of inflation is uncorrelated with the expected rate of inflation. In our empirical investigations, we use data on the log change in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for All Urban Customers (All Items) obtained from the Bureau of Labor Statistics to proxy for inflation. To estimate the expected and unexpected component of inflation, we choose an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model according to the Bayesian information criterion (BIC).
	Here is the cleaned text:3.2. Systematic illiquidityThere is evidence that illiquidity represents a systematic risk factor in the equity market (see e.g. Amihud, 2002; Jones, 2002; Pastor and Stambaugh, 2003) and in the government bond market (see e.g. Amihud and Mendelson, 1991; Goldreich et al., 2005). Regarding the cross-market impact of illiquidity, Chordia et al. (2005) find that illiquidity on the equity and the bond market strongly covary while the recent study of Goyenko and Ukhov (2009) provides evidence that there is a lead-lag relation and bi-directional Granger causality between illiquidity in these two markets. In particular, a shock to stock market illiquidity significantly affects the bond market which is consistent with the flight-to-quality (also often referred to as flight-to-liquidity) phenomenon. In periods of financial turmoil, investors tend to exit the illiquid stock market and enter the highly liquid Treasury bond market resulting in a price pressure effect that induces negative equity-bond return correlations. Our proxy for stock market illiquidity is the measure of price impact developed by Amihud (2002) that can be easily obtained from daily data. Monthly stock market illiquidity is calculated by:IL Stock,t = 1/Dt ∑d=1 |rd,t| / ln(Vd,t), (3.2)where rd,t is the stock market return on day d in month t, Vd,t is the dollar volume on day d in month t, and Dt denotes the number of trading days in month t.To capture U.S. bond market illiquidity, we use the quoted bid-ask spread which represents the most effective measure to track illiquidity changes in the Treasury bond market (see e.g. Fleming, 2003 and Goldreich et al., 2003). Using data on the 10-year Treasury note, we calculate the monthly relative bid-ask spread by:IL Bond,t = 1/Dt ∑d=1 (YB,d,t -YA,d,t) / (YB,d,t + YA,d,t). (3.3)Here, YB,d,t is the quoted bid, YA,d,t is the quoted ask yield on day d in month t, and Dt is the number of trading days in month t. As the bid yield is higher than the corresponding ask yield, the spread is positive and gets wider with increasing bond market illiquidity.3.3. Stock market uncertaintyStock market uncertainty is supposed to have important cross-market impact and to influence the joint pricing of equities and bonds. Consistent with the notion of flight-to-quality, the probability of observing a negative future equity-bond correlation is shown to be higher in times of high stock market uncertainty which directly affects the diversification benefit of equities and bonds (see e.g. Connolly et al., 2005).We use realized volatility of the S&P 500 index as a gauge for uncertainty on the U.S. stock market. For relatively long time horizons, high-frequency intraday data is typically not available and the realized volatility estimator is based on standard deviations or variances of daily close-to-close returns. We rely on the Garman and Klass (1980) measure of realized variance that contains additional information on intraday variability by including opening-, high-, low- and closing prices. Average monthly realized variance is then calculated by:rv GK,t = 1/Dt ∑d=1 [(0.5p2d - (2ln2 - 1)q2d)], (3.4)where pd = ln(Hd/Ld) represents the range between high price Hd and low price Ld on day d. The open-to-close return on day d is captured by qd = ln(Cd/Od) where Cd denotes the closing price on day d and Od is the opening price on day d.4. How do economic factors affect equity-bond covariance?Model (2.8) implies that covariance risk influences the expected return of equities and bonds. As such, factors that significantly affect conditional equity-bond covariance have an indirect impact on expected equity and bond returns. If equities and bonds exhibit different (similar) exposures to shocks in economic variables, these shocks are likely to predict a decrease (increase) in conditional covariance. We aim to identify these determinants of equity-bond covariance by using a threshold VAR that is able to capture non-linear predictability patterns. The TVAR (m) setting with j = 1, ..., m threshold regimes is given by:yt = ⎧⎪⎪⎨⎪⎪⎩c(1) + ∑p i=1 β(1)i yt-i + ∑q i=1 γ(1)i xt-i + ϵ(1)t if zt-q ≤ τ1,c(2) + ∑p i=1 β(2)i yt-i + ∑q i=1 γ(2)i xt-i + ϵ(2)t if τ1 < zt-q ≤ τ2,...c(m) + ∑p i=1 β(m)i yt-i + ∑q i=1 γ(m)i xt-i + ϵ(m)t if zt-q > τm-1, (4.1)where τj denotes the threshold value and c(j) is the intercept in the j-th regime. The vector yt = (y1t, ..., ykt)' contains equity and bond returns and k-2 additional endogenous variables, xt = (x1t, ..., xνt)' is a vector of exogenous variables, and ϵt is a vector of error terms.

Empirical evidenceOur sample period ranges from January 1965 to December 2017 resulting in 636 monthly observations of equity and bond returns. We measure U.S. equity returns, r M, by the broadest possible stock market index and observe monthly value-weighted returns of all U.S. equities listed on NYSE, Amex or Nasdaq from Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP). Monthly bond returns, r B, are proxied by the U.S. ten-year Treasury bond returns. Both series measure the return from end of month t-1 until end of month t. The nominal risk-free rate, r f, is proxied by the U.S. Treasury bill with one month until maturity.Descriptive statistics for the return data is provided in Panel A of Table 1. Typically, equity returns are more volatile than bond returns and yield higher expected returns. Over the entire sample, the average monthly return of the equity market portfolio is 0.91% which corresponds to a mean of 10.89% on an annual basis. The returns on the government bond portfolio and the risk-free rate yield a monthly average of 0.57% and 0.39%, which corresponds to an annualized average return of 6.48% and 4.68%, respectively. As one would expect, bond returns and the risk-free rate exhibit significant autocorrelations at least up to lag 9 and all series are non-normal distributed as indicated by the Jarque Bera (JB) statistics. Panel B of Table 1 reports Pearson correlations of the market return series and the corresponding t-values of a two-tailed test. The (unconditional) correlation between equity and bond market returns is positive with a value of 14.1% and highly significant. Consistent to earlier studies such as Ang and Bekaert (2007) and Campbell (1987), equity market returns are negatively correlated with the Treasury bill rate, however, not statistically significant on conventional levels. We further estimate a positive and significant correlation between government bond returns and the risk-free rate.
	I have removed the unwanted information and formatting from the text to give you the exact text of the original scientific article:5.2 Asset pricing model estimation resultsThe conditional model (2.8) implies that the expected equity and bond market returns are related to variance risk and equity-bond covariance risk. Thereby, the model allows to allocate a unique market price to each risk component, that is, the market price of variance risk and the market price of equity-bond covariance risk, which may potentially differ across the equity and the bond market. Our empirical investigations start with the standard version of the conditional model that postulates that the expected return is linearly related only to conditional variance. We then provide empirical evidence regarding the pricing of equity-bond covariance risk.5.2.1 Market price of variance riskTo deliver first insights on the market price of variance risk on the equity and the bond market, we impose the constraint on λH = 0 in Model (2.8). We follow standard convention in tests of the ICAPM and estimate a GARCH-in-mean model to infer the risk-return relationship of equities and bonds.Table 2 reports quasi maximum likelihood estimation (QMLE) results of the GARCH-in-mean model under the assumption of asymmetry according to Glosten et al. (1993) and Student t-distributed errors. Empirical models commonly include an intercept to control for potential model misspecifications or to account for market imperfections (see e.g. Scruggs, 1998). We estimate the risk-return relation with inclusion of an intercept term in (I). As implied by the theoretical model, we further constrain the intercept to be zero in (II). Regarding the estimation of conditional variance, our results show positive and highly significant first-order autoregressive coefficients, βM and βB, which indicate that there is strong short-term persistence of conditional variance on both markets. The positive and significant estimate of the asymmetry parameter γM shows an asymmetric response of conditional equity market variance to news. An unexpected negative equity market return (bad news) sharply increases conditional equity market variance, while an unexpected positive equity market return (good news) decreases conditional equity market variance. Interestingly, the estimate of the asymmetry parameter γB is not significantly different from zero. This suggests that conditional bond market variance is not responsive to lagged bond market return innovations. Residual diagnostics support an appropriate fit of the time-series model.Regarding the conditional mean equation, we observe positive market price of variance risk estimates, λM and λB. This is in line with the theoretical prediction that periods of high conditional equity and bond variance, respectively, are associated with higher expected returns. Note that λM and λB both turn statistically insignificant once the intercept is included. This is consistent with Lanne and Saikkonen (2006) who argue that the inclusion of an intercept term may distort estimates of the risk-return parameter and recommend imposing a zero restriction on the intercept term such as in the original ICAPM by Merton.According to Glosten et al. (1993), for example, the Treasury bill rate might have significant impact on the conditional market variance and the risk-return relation. Therefore, we test whether our findings are robust regarding an inclusion of the risk-free rate as explanatory variable in the conditional mean and conditional variance equation. As shown in Table 3, the coefficient estimate νrf,M as well as νrf,B indicate that conditional equity and bond market variance are significantly affected by the risk-free rate. The inclusion of the risk-free rate, however, does not bias the estimation results of the remaining parameters in the variance equation of equity and bond returns. Our results on λrf,M show that the risk-free rate has no statistically significant impact on conditional equity market returns. In contrast, we observe a positive and significant coefficient λrf,B. The latter findings are consistent with the reported results regarding the correlations between equity and bond returns and the risk-free rate.Overall, our results show that the market price of variance risk is positive and economically significant implying that equity and bond investors demand higher expected returns for bearing higher conditional risk. While the statistical significance of the relation between conditional returns and conditional variance depends crucially on model restrictions regarding the intercept term, the risk-free rate does not bias the risk-return relation.5.2.2 Market price of equity-bond covariance riskIn practice, one faces the challenge that conditional second moments are not observable. In our setting, we rely on two measures of moments. First, we assume conditional variance of stock and bond returns both to follow an asymmetric GARCH(1,1) process. Standardized residuals of the univariate GARCH models are then used to estimate the conditional stock-bond covariance according to the dynamic conditional correlation (DCC) model of Engle (2002).One of the main objectives of this study is to answer the question whether conditional equity-bond covariance is priced on the equity and on the bond market. In our pricing tests, we follow an estimation procedure similar to Bali and Engle (2010) and observe estimates of conditional equity-bond covariance in a first step. In a second step, we estimate the mean equation of equities and bonds simultaneously using seemingly unrelated regressions (SUR) to account for contemporaneously correlated error terms associated with the equity and bond equation.Panel A of Table 4 shows the QMLE results of the DCC GARCH (1,1) model under the assumption of multivariate Student t-distributed errors. A comparison of the estimated conditional variance equation parameters to those in Table 2 shows that the results do not substantially differ. Still, the coefficients βM and βB are positive, high in magnitude and highly significant.

The parameters of the DCC model are both estimated to be positive with a small magnitude of αdcc = 0.03 and a large magnitude of βdcc = 0.96. The sum of the DCC parameters, (αdcc + βdcc < 1), implies that the conditional correlations exhibit mean reversion behavior.Turning to the market prices of variance risk, we observe positive market prices of variance risk, λM and λB. Foremost, our results show that the market price of covariance risk is robust to the inclusion of a constant term, λ0. While the statistical significance of λM and λB completely vanishes, the coefficient λH remains positive and significant in the equity and the bond equation.Likelihood ratio (LR) tests are used to test whether an unrestricted model fits significantly better than variations of a restricted model with constraints on λ0 and λH. The result of the χ2-distributed LR test statistics for the model restrictions are reported in Panel B of Table 4. Regarding the restriction on the intercept λ0, the LR-test result implies that the constant term is necessary for an adequate model specification. This is intuitive as we focus on simple returns rather than on excess returns.We further observe a p-value of less than 0.01 regarding restrictions on λH indicating that the additional consideration of equity-bond covariance risk yields a significantly better fit than the single-factor standard model.Our setting, thus far, relies on conditional variance and covariance estimated from monthly asset returns derived by the DCC framework. While the use of monthly data is a standard procedure in asset pricing tests, one drawback is the bulk of past information that is not considered. To account for the information contained in higher frequency data, we perform additional tests by relating monthly expected asset returns to realized moments derived from daily asset returns.In particular, we rely on a measure of realized volatility that is constructed as the sum of past month's daily squared equity and bond returns, and, similarly, past month's daily asset returns are used to derive realized equity-bond covariance. Table 5 shows that our results are robust to the alternative specifications of moments. As shown in Panel A of Table 5, the estimated parameters λH,M and λH,B yield positive values and statistical significance in the equity as well as in the bond equation, which provides further evidence that equity-bond covariance risk plays a significant role in explaining expected returns on both markets.The LR tests in Panel B of Table 5 further confirm that including the equity-bond covariance component in the pricing model yields a significantly better fit in explaining expected asset returns.Overall, the presented results provide robust evidence that covariance risk is priced. The significant pricing implies that conditional covariance is affected by shocks that correlate with marginal utility of wealth. If the time-variation in conditional covariance would not be affected by intertemporal risk, then investors would behave myopically in their portfolio choice and there would be no need for the second component of our model. Under the latter conditions, results regarding the pricing of covariance risk would be trivial.

As equity-bond covariance risk matters for the stock market and the bond market, expected returns of both assets are affected by the time-variation in conditional covariance.5.3. Implications of the equity-bond pricing relationshipThis section illustrates important implications of covariance risk in explaining the time-variation of expected asset returns. Our Model (2.8) captures the dynamic hedging demand of investors and is able to map the pricing effects of two market phenomena: (i) Safe haven allocations during flight-to-quality episodes and (ii) allocations to risky assets and market price rallies that occur under fear-of-missing-out.In our setting, we assume that flight-to-quality episodes are characterized by high (above average) equity market volatility representing increased market stress and negative equity-bond covariance induced by high realized positive bond returns relative to realized equity returns (see also Baele et al., 2020 and Durand et al., 2010). Further, we identify and characterize fear-of-missing-out episodes with respect to the equity market by two criteria. First, fear-of-missing-out episodes coincide with a higher incidence of positive equity return shocks and low equity market volatility. Second, the rising equity market is accompanied by a contemporaneous price depression in the bond market resulting in a high realized equity-bond return spread and negative equity-bond covariance.Fig. 1 shows the monthly data-implied DCC conditional covariance as well as realized covariance along with the regimes of flight-to-quality and fear-of-missing-out identified according to the defined criteria. An overall look clearly reveals a time-variation in conditional covariance that is consistent with the dynamic hedging demand of investors and the time-variation in expected returns of both assets.

This implies that bonds were relatively risky with respect to stocks until the millennium and then hedging effects got apparent. Further, as flight-to-quality and fear-of-missing-out effects are associated with negative covariance, the shift in conditional covariance implies that such episodes merely occurred after the millennium. Focusing on realized moments, a different picture is drawn. Besides the downward shift in equity-bond correlation and covariance, respectively, negative instances of realized moments and associated episodes of flight-to-quality and fear-of-missing-out are not a recent phenomenon but were frequently observed during the last decades.Table 6 reports monthly expected equity and bond returns implied by Model (2.8) over the sample period from January 1965 to December 2017. Panel A reports the numerical illustrations based on sample estimates of conditional variance and conditional covariance estimated by the DCC model. As shown in the first column, the full sample average of conditional covariance is 0.0161% which corresponds to an average conditional correlation of 17.99%. Along with the conditional equity market volatility of 0.2166%, equities yield a monthly expected return of 0.7258%, on average, and a corresponding annualized expected equity premium of 4.04%. The latter represents a plausible and realistic model-implied estimate of the equity premium and is consistent with documented expectations of the equity premium (see for example De Long and Magin, 2009 for an overview on equity premium expectations).Note: I removed the information about the authors, journal, and table numbers as they are not part of the original scientific article.
	Here is the cleaned text without unwanted information:Pricing Equity-Bond Covariance Risk based on Realized Moments. Panel A reports estimated parameters of the equity and bond mean equation.

Across the full sample, 478 monthly observations fall within episodes of positive conditional covariance and 158 monthly observations fall within episodes of negative conditional covariance.As the hedging effect dominates during periods of negative conditional covariance, model-implied expected returns on the bond and the equity market, in general, are lower than the expected asset returns during periods of positive conditional covariance. Across the full sample period, 27 months (4.3% of the sample) are identified as flight-to-quality episodes while fear-of-missing-out episodes comprise 66 months (10.4% of the sample).As shown, flight-to-quality episodes coincide with abnormal low conditional equity-bond covariance that yield an average value of -0.0181% along with a high level of average conditional equity market volatility (0.4291%). During flight-to-quality episodes, the increasing hedging demand of risk-averse investors makes the government bond market more attractive resulting in price pressure mechanism that contemporaneously pushes up the bond prices and yields a compression of the expected bond market return.The latter effect is captured by Model (2.8) which implies a lower expected bond market return of 0.1331% relative to the high expected equity market return of 0.3815% under flight-to-quality. On the contrary, fear-of-missing-out is characterized by portfolio shifts from bonds towards equities and low average conditional equity-bond covariance of -0.0102%. The fear-of-missing-out pressure along with the higher demand of investors for risky assets results in skimpy risk premiums and a low expected equity market return of 0.0364% relative to a higher expected bond return of 0.0999%.Baele et al. (2020) show that flight-to-quality episodes are predominantly short-lived and merely last only a few days. Therefore, we further aim to identify flight-to-quality and fear-of-missing-out regimes relying on daily data. Fig. 2 graphs daily conditional covariance derived by DCC estimation along with the regimes of flight-to-quality and fear-of-missing-out.Descriptive statistics using daily conditional moments are reported in Panel B of Table 6. Across the full sample period, 7.2% of daily observations fall within flight-to-quality episodes while fear-of-missing-out days account for 10.7% of the sample.To illustrate model-implied expected returns across flight-to-quality and fear-of-missing-out episodes on a monthly basis, the sample average of daily conditional variance and covariance are also expressed in monthly terms. As such, we assume that the sample averages of flight-to-quality and fear-of-missing-out days hold on a monthly basis, i.e. we illustrate model-implied expected returns assuming that all days in a month are flight-to-quality or fear-of-missing-out days, respectively.Since the daily conditional covariance estimates yield much more dispersion over time, the model-implied expected returns differ from the estimates in Panel A. Our conclusions regarding flight-to-quality and fear-of-missing-out effects still hold. The results overall show that high equity market volatility during flight-to-quality days coincides with higher expected return on equities relative to low expected bond return. On the contrary, fear-of-missing-out leads to a compression of the expected equity return relative to the higher expected bond return.In Panel C of Table 6, we identify flight-to-quality and fear-of-missing-out episodes using realized variance and covariance as proxies for conditional moments. Focusing on realized moments results in a higher number of flight-to-quality and fear-of-missing-out episodes. Across the sample, we observe 63 flight-to-quality months and 87 fear-of-missing-out months.

The upper graph plots monthly DCC conditional equity-bond covariance along with monthly flight-to-quality and fear-of-missing-out regimes identified using DCC estimates of moments. The lower graph plots monthly realized equity-bond covariance as measured by past month’s daily equity and bond returns along with monthly flight-to-quality and fear-of-missing-out regimes identified by realized moments. The sample period ranges from January 1965 to December 2017 and covers 636 monthly observations and 13,198 daily observations, respectively.Regarding the model-implied expected returns across flight-to-quality and fear-of-missing-out episodes, our results remain qualitatively similar. Flight-to-quality episodes yield high expected equity market returns of 0.2911%.For the numerical illustrations regarding realized measures of moments, we rely on the market price of variance and covariance risk estimates derived in Table 5. In particular, λM = 2.07, λB = 4.14, λH,M = 12.38, and λH,B = 2.99.

Covariance risk determinantsThus far, our results show that equity-bond covariance risk is priced in the equity and the bond market and plays a significant role in explaining expected asset returns. Our subsequent objective is now to identify determinants that induce time-variation in conditional covariance and thus may also represent drivers of flight-to-quality and fear-of-missing-out effects.5.4.1. VAR analysisIn general, economic variables that affect either stock or bond returns or the returns of both assets simultaneously may generate changes in stock-bond covariance. To identify the economic determinants, we first estimate a linear model and then use a threshold VAR to account for non-linearity as described in Section 4. Table 7 shows the results of bi-directional Granger causality tests for equity and bond returns and shocks to inflation, shocks to stock market illiquidity and shocks to bond market illiquidity as endogenous variables. We find that there is strong bi-directional causality between stock and bond returns indicating that equity market returns are able to predict bond returns, and vice versa. Stock market illiquidity proxied by the illiquidity measure of Amihud (2002) Granger causes bond market illiquidity. However, bond market illiquidity has no causality effect over stock market illiquidity. Inflation shocks significantly affect only future bond returns but seem to have no statistical significant impact on future equity returns. Overall, the observed results show that the considered variables are able to predict the direction of equity or bond returns which makes them potential candidates to explain time-variations in equity-bond covariance.5.4.2. Threshold VAR analysisIn the presence of non-linearities that are commonly revealed in financial time series, linear VAR findings become not reliable. Therefore, we allow the stock and bond market returns to respond to shocks in the endogenous variables in a non-linear fashion. In particular, we examine whether the stock-bond return dynamics show significant differences across different states of expected inflation, πE. For this, we first conduct likelihood ratio tests presented in Eq. B.2 to detect whether the level of expected inflation implies significant threshold effects. Panel A of Table 8 presents the results of the LR tests.

	Here is the text of the original scientific article, removing unwanted information and artefacts:Fig. 3. Threshold Estimation: Expected Inflation. The upper graph plots monthly expected inflation, πE, from January 1965 to December 2017. A grid search is used to estimate the lower threshold, τ1 = 0.001408158 (solid line), and the upper threshold, τ1 = 0.004231543 (dotted line), by minimizing the SSE as described in Appendix B. The lower graph illustrates the ordered values of expected inflation that are considered within the grid search. The vertical trim lines illustrate that at least 15% of sample observations lie in the low and the high threshold regime.The SSE at threshold τ1 = 0.0014 and threshold τ2 = 0.0042 which correspond to an annualized expected inflation of 1.68% and 5.07%, respectively. The lower threshold is thus just below the 2 percent inflation objective adopted by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).In the upper graph of Fig. 3, the level of expected inflation over the entire sample period is illustrated. τ1 is represented by the solid line and the dotted line graphs the second threshold τ2. The two thresholds divide the sample into a low (16.7% of observations), medium (59.5%) and high regime (23.8%) of expected inflation. As the graph shows, the high threshold regime covers, for example, the period of ‘Great Inflation’ in the 1960s and 1970s associated with abnormal high levels of expected inflation reaching a peak of 14.04% (p.a.). The graph further shows that abnormal low inflation expectations predominantly occurred in the years following the global financial crisis in 2008.Table 8 shows the results of the TVAR model where the transitions among the different regimes of expected inflation are determined by the estimated threshold values. As one would intuitively expect, a negative response of bond market returns to shocks in inflation can be documented in each of the three threshold regimes. This indicates that positive shocks to inflation generally represent bad news for the nominal bond market and depress future returns. In contrast, our results show that the response of stock market returns is state-dependent and varies across regimes of expected inflation. In particular, we observe a negative response of stock market returns to inflation shocks when inflation expectations are high. The equity market takes positive shocks to inflation as an indication of deteriorated future business conditions leading to a higher probability of observing decreasing future equity prices and returns.In a low state of expected inflation, positive shocks to inflation predict a positive (albeit not significant) increase of equity market returns. An economic explanation is that during times of low expected inflation, equity investors take an unanticipated increase in expected inflation as a signal for future economic recovery. Thus, a positive shock to inflation represents good news for the stock market resulting in rising future equity prices. The differential response of stock and bond market returns to inflation shocks may be one explanation for observing a negative covariance in periods of low expected inflation.Next, notice the interaction of stock market and bond market illiquidity. During low and high episodes of expected inflation, we find a strong illiquidity spillover from the bond to the stock market. In particular, a shock to bond market illiquidity leads to a significant increase in future stock market illiquidity. This cross-market illiquidity spillover may be caused by monetary policy shocks that have an immediate impact on bond illiquidity, which transmits these shocks into stock market illiquidity (see e.g. Goyenko and Ukhov, 2009). As a spillover effect cannot be observed during periods of medium expected inflation, our results indicate that bond illiquidity may indeed act as a channel to transmit monetary policy shocks to the stock market, but only in periods of abnormal low and high levels of expected inflation.We further aim to examine whether the response to shocks to endogenous variables show significant differences across different states of stock market uncertainty. Therefore, we estimate a TVAR model with m = 3 threshold regimes and Garman-Klass realized stock market volatility, rv GK, that triggers changes between the uncertainty regimes. The upper graph in Fig. 4 shows realized volatility over the sample period and the thresholds estimated via grid search, τ1 = 0.00 3 and τ2 = 0.00 9, which are illustrated by the solid line and the dotted line, respectively. The lower graph shows all possible threshold values that are considered within the grid search. The regime of low stock market uncertainty covers 33% of observations and the regime of high stock market uncertainty includes 20.2% of the sample observations.
	Here is the cleaned-up text without unwanted information:Threshold Estimation: Realized Volatility. The upper figure plots monthly Garman-Klass realized volatility, rv GK, from January 1965 to December 2017. The estimated lower threshold, τ1 = 0.00373665, and the upper threshold, τ2 = 0.09469036, are illustrated by the solid and the dotted line, respectively. The lower graph illustrates the ordered values of realized volatility that are considered within the grid search. The vertical trim lines illustrate that the low and high threshold regime cover at least 15% of total sample observations.The estimation results of the TVAR(3) model are presented in Table 9. In general, bond returns are positively correlated with future stock market returns. This is intuitive as equities and bonds both represent high duration assets (see e.g. Baele et al., 2010). However, this relation is only significantly present during periods of low stock market uncertainty. During periods of high uncertainty, our results show that a decline in equity market returns is associated with rising bond returns and a decline of equity-bond covariance. Stock and bond returns predominantly differ in their response to bond market illiquidity shocks during periods of high stock market uncertainty. A positive shock to bond market illiquidity thereby drives stock and bond returns in opposite directions while equity and bond market returns show a similar response to shocks to aggregate stock market illiquidity. These findings further contribute to those of Goyenko and Ukhov (2009) who investigate the linkage between stock and bond market illiquidity in a linear VAR setting that does not account for non-linear cross-market behavior.6. ConclusionIn this article, we suggest that the pricing of stock-bond covariance risk can be seen as an important key in explaining the time-variation in expected equity and government bond returns. Risk-averse investors are willing to pay a premium for holding an asset that forms a hedge against changes in future investment opportunities. During episodes of low stock-bond covariance, the hedging benefit of the bond portfolio balances the low expected bond returns that are typically associated with flight-to-quality effects. On the contrary, allocations to risky assets under fear-of-missing-out result in low expected equity returns relative to expected bond returns. As our findings show that time-variation in the equity-bond covariance matters for expected returns of both asset classes, it is of particular interest to identify its determinants. We suggest that shocks to anticipated inflation are main drivers of future stock and bond prices. While bond returns generally show a negative response to inflation shocks, equity prices may either decrease or increase depending on the level of expected inflation. We ascribe this ambiguous effect to a non-linear role that shocks to inflation have in predicting future business conditions.Our results further suggest that equity-bond covariance is affected by systematic market illiquidity, which leads to a variation in covariance across different states of uncertainty. The documented asymmetric impact of shocks and the associated joint dynamics may also be related to market participants' investment behavior as recently suggested by Li et al. (2016), Dieci et al. (2018), and Schmitt and Westerhoff (2019).As equities and bonds are major asset classes, our study has important implications regarding investors' asset allocation decisions. Equity-bond covariance risk as a proxy for changes in the investment opportunity set does not only matter for equity investors but also plays a crucial role for bond-only investors. Our findings show that the state of the economy is essential for investors to predict how unexpected inflation or unexpected changes in market liquidity will affect expected equity and bond market returns. Incorporating these findings in investment decisions may provide benefits especially under tense market conditions as characterized by low expected inflation and high uncertainty.Appendix A.

	Here is the cleaned-up text of the scientific article:The conditional variance equation represents the GARCH model of Glosten et al. (1993) that allows an asymmetric modeling of positive and negative shocks on conditional variance by the indicator function I that takes on a value of 1 for ε ≤ 0 and 0 otherwise. The so-called leverage term captures the asymmetric response and is represented by γ.The DCC model of Engle (2002) decomposes conditional covariance such that Ht = Dt Rt Dt. Dt is a diagonal matrix of time-varying standard deviations from univariate GARCH models, and Rt is the matrix of time-varying conditional correlations. The evolution of the correlation structure is given by Qt = (1 - αdcc - βdcc) ¯Q + αdcc εt-1 ε't-1 + βdcc Qt-1, Rt = diag{Qt}-1/2 Qt diag{Qt}-1/2, where ¯Q is the unconditional covariance of the standardized residuals. The model assumes that conditional correlations are driven by lagged standardized residuals and an additional autoregressive term. The system is estimated by maximizing the log-likelihood function assuming that the residuals follow a Student t distribution.Appendix B. Modeling Threshold EffectsIn estimating the TVAR model, we assume that the threshold variable zt is a priori known. If the value of the threshold τ is known with certainty, estimation of the slope coefficients can be done straightforwardly by using ordinary least squares (OLS) estimation. In practice, the value of the threshold is unobservable and must be estimated. The minimization of the concentrated sum of squared errors (SSE) yields the least squares estimators of the first threshold (see e.g. Hansen, 1999b): τ1 = argmin {τ} SSE(τ).Eq. B.1 shows that computation of the least squares estimate of the threshold value involves a minimization problem. This problem can be solved through a grid search (see e.g. Balke and Fomby, 1997): The values of the threshold variable zt are sorted with a certain percentage of smallest and largest values that are excluded to ensure a minimal percentage of observations in each regime. The remaining values contain all possible values of the threshold τ that can be used to estimate τ. For each of the possible values of τ, the SSE is estimated, and the one that minimizes the SSE is chosen as the best unique threshold τ. The estimation procedure for two thresholds can be conducted in a similar way by searching for combinations of the first threshold τ1 and the second threshold τ2 that together minimize the SSE(τ1, τ2). To reduce computational effort, the second threshold can be estimated conditional on the first threshold, i.e., holding the first threshold τ1 fixed.In order to test for non-linear threshold effects, we use the sup-LR statistics proposed by Lo and Zivot (2001) that compares the covariance matrix of the linear model and the threshold model:LR1m = T (ln(|ˆΣ11|) - ln(|ˆΣ1m|)).Here, ˆΣ11 and ˆΣ1m denote the estimated residual covariance matrix of the linear VAR and the TVAR(m) with m threshold regimes, respectively, and sample size T. In our empirical application, we use the bootstrapping method of Hansen (1999b) to compute p-values of the linearity test statistics.

	Here is the extracted text without unwanted information and artefacts:About the fear of reputational loss: Social trading and the disposition effectMatthias Pelster and Annette HofmannThis article studies the relationship between giving financial advice and the disposition effect in an online trading environment. Our empirical findings suggest that leader traders are more susceptible to the disposition effect than investors who are not being followed by any other trader. Using a difference-in-differences approach, we show that becoming a first-time financial advisor increases the disposition effect. This finding holds for investors who engage in foreign exchange trading and for investors who trade stocks and stock market indices. The increased behavioral bias may be explained by leaders feeling responsible to their followers, by a fear of losing followers when admitting a poor investment decision, or by an attempt by newly appointed leaders to manage their social image and self-image.Social trading is a novel way to participate in financial markets. In the past, financial market participants had to commission financial intermediaries to execute their trades. Today, an innovative combination of social networks and online trading—so-called social trading platforms—allows investors to buy and sell securities with very low entry barriers. In addition, these online platforms allow investors to interact with one another and view other investors' trading activities. Investors can easily observe the trading behavior of their peers and replicate trading strategies by others, without the help of a professional broker.A commonly used feature of many platforms is the traders' ability to copy other platform users, which can be done manually (advice trading), or automatically (delegation trading). We use this copy feature of social trading to categorize investors into four types, according to their degree of social interaction: investors who (i) manually duplicate the investment strategies of other traders, (ii) automatically replicate the investment strategies of other traders, (iii) are leaders who signal their investment strategies to other traders, and (iv) are followers who receive investment advice from other traders.The increased behavioral bias may be explained by leaders feeling responsible to their followers, by a fear of losing followers when admitting a poor investment decision, or by an attempt by newly appointed leaders to manage their social image and self-image.Note that leader traders—the signal providers whose investment strategies are duplicated by other traders—receive a payment for sharing their trading strategies. The amount of money received varies with the number of followers, the platform type, and the success of trading strategies. In this sense, social trading platforms can be seen as potential substitutes for common asset management services; they facilitate access to financial markets for traders outside the financial sector.

Hofmann / Journal of Banking and Finance 94 (2018) 75–88(advice traders), (ii) automatically duplicate the investment strategy of one or more selected other investors (“delegation traders”), (iii) have their investment strategies copied by other investors (“leader traders”), and (iv) execute trades on their own without copying other investors or being copied (“autonomous traders”).Then, we investigate whether investment behavior differs significantly across these trader types. In particular, we study whether leader traders significantly differ from autonomous investors with respect to their disposition effect —i.e., the tendency of investors to forego loss realization in favor of gain realization. We study whether investors increase their disposition effect once they become leaders.Social trading may alter investors’ behavior. Recent literature provides convincing evidence that investors tend to value the advice of non-expert friends before making financial decisions (Van Rooij et al., 2011; Qin, 2012). Heimer (2016) shows that for investors who trade open to the public, the disposition effect tends to be higher than in a common trading setting without any social interactions among traders and reasons that impression management contributes to the disposition effect.He argues that social investors’ strategic efforts to convey a positive image may increase their disposition effect, stating that the appearance of success enables more socially persuasive interaction with others. In line with the social transmission theory by Han et al. (2017), he argues that traders value the option to recount victories and seek to report positively about themselves. In contrast, with a losing position in their portfolio, traders not only have to admit failure to themselves but also to their peers.As a result, Heimer (2016) argues that financial peer effects—like the disposition effect—asymmetrically relate to gains and losses. This notion is supported by the contemporaneous experimental study of Hermann et al. (2017), who show that investors making investment decisions for others are significantly more susceptible to the disposition effect.While Heimer (2016) considers the trading behavior of investors who share their trading activity with other investors in general, our focus is on a specific group of traders in social trading, the (unprofessional) financial advisors or leaders —who provide peer-to-peer advice. We argue that investors who are being followed by their peers are most closely monitored by their peers and, therefore, have an increased urge to manage their social and self-image which increases their disposition effect.Investors are often subject to limited attention and processing power (Hirshleifer and Teoh, 2003). Thus, investors are not able to observe the trading behavior of all their peers. However, some investors on social trading platforms have a large number of other investors that observe their investment decisions. We argue that investors will become especially concerned about their online reputation and their increased transparency, when other investors start to follow their trading activities.Several psychological mechanisms may cause investors to increase their disposition effect once they become leaders. First, leaders may feel a sense of responsibility for their followers. Leaders may believe that they have failed their followers when they close a losing position, and by doing so need to accept a loss for their followers. Investors may thus become more susceptible to the disposition effect once they are leader traders.Second, leader traders may fear that their followers are disappointed by a loss and terminate the leader-follower relationship. This fear may increase their vulnerability to the disposition effect. Finally, first-time leaders may change their investment behavior in a desire to improve both their social and self-image. Indeed, as argued by Elster (2009), feelings such as guilt and shame are associated with worse social and self-image, respectively.Leaders may decide to keep their losing positions open to signal confidence in their initial investment decisions. Burks et al. (2013) note that (over)confidence may be driven by the desire to send positive signals to others about one’s own skill. Closing a losing position signals a bad investment decision. However, keeping the position open signals that the leader still believes in her initial decision and is confident that the security will increase in value. Thus, an investor who is being followed by other investors may keep losing positions open as a result of a bias in judgment or strategic lying to manage her social and self-image.This article adds additional insight to the existing list of possible explanations for why investment advisors tend to be prone to the disposition effect. Exploiting a dataset containing approx. 150 million trading observations from 354,817 unique traders for the period from January 2012 through October 2015, this article answers the question whether leader traders are more prone to the disposition effect. Our results support the hypothesis that traders who are being followed by other investors are more susceptible to the disposition effect.The paper is organized as follows. The next section describes the trading platform and the data and discusses summary statistics. Section 3 presents our main results by analyzing the trading behavior of different traders. The last section discusses results and concludes.2. Data2.1. The trading platformThe following analysis is based on individual investors’ transaction data from the online social trading platform eToro . Trading with eToro allows following and/or copying or replicating trades of other traders. The platform permits its traders to trade contracts for difference (CFD) that cover currency pairs, stocks, commodities and indices by taking short and long positions. Investors can start their trading activity after paying a minimum deposit amount varying between $50 and $300, depending on region, and leverage trades up to 400 times. eToro does not charge any explicit transaction fees but is compensated through a portion of the bid/ask spread of the trades its investors place.eToro’s most prominent feature is the option to Open Book Trading , meaning that investors can access other investors’ trades in real-time, allowing them to see the trades made by others and decide whether to follow or copy those trades.
	Here is the cleaned text of the scientific article:The platform offers full trading transparency. Each user's current portfolio, full track record, risk score, and success/failure ratio are available for all users to see. Traders can observe all current and past positions of others, including their paper and realized returns. In particular, investors' trading information includes the investor's full trading history. Moreover, investors can observe the current portfolio of all other traders who trade Open Book. Note that, among other statistics, an investor's fraction of winning trades is displayed very prominently within this information.Similar to other social trading platforms, traders on eToro can either manually or automatically duplicate the trading strategies of others. Traders can observe others and then copy trades that capture their interest. eToro also permits traders to trade passively, i.e. other investors' trades are automatically copied (delegation or mirror trading). To do so, traders must allocate a proportion of their equity (up to 100% or $500,000) to another investor they want to mirror. Followed traders are copied proportionally, meaning that if the followed trader risks 1% of her equity on a specific trade, then eToro will use exactly 1% of the trader's allocated equity to mirror that trade. Alternatively, a trader can manually copy trades of others with the click of a mouse (advice trading).A copy trader (i.e., follower) must consider the following eToro rules: (1) The minimum amount to invest in one trader is $200. (2) The maximum amount s/he can invest in one trader is $500,000. (3) The maximum amount of traders s/he can copy simultaneously is 100. (4) The minimum amount for a copied trade is $1; trades below this amount will not be opened. (5) If s/he closes a copied trade manually, the funds from this position will be credited back to his or her copy balance (the amount allocated to copy that trader).Leader traders receive compensation by eToro for being followed. The compensation is based on a graduated scale with four levels and comprises three components. The three components are reduced transaction fees between 20% and 100% of the spreads, fixed monthly payments of up to $1,000, and, thirdly, a monthly payment of 2% of their assets under management. On the lowest level, leaders are compensated with 20% of the spreads, while on the fourth and highest level, leaders are compensated with 100% of the spreads and a fixed monthly payment of $1,000 plus 2% of their assets under management.Our dataset consists of all trades that took place on eToro between January 1, 2012, and October 8, 2015. The dataset contains all trades of traders who executed at least five trades during the sample period. In total, approximately 150 million trades were executed during this period by a total of 354,817 traders.Regarding the different trade types, approximately 19.1% are autonomous, 4.2% are leading, 71.7% are delegation, and 5.0% are advice trades. Traders engaged in trading activity through 312 instruments. Among the instruments traded most heavily are foreign exchange rates, representing approx. 85% of all transactions, several stock market indices (approx. 7% of all transactions), and some single-name stocks (approx. 1% of all transactions). Furthermore, investors engage in commodities and digital currency trading.To quantify the extent to which an investor is subject to the disposition effect, we follow Odean (1998) and Strahilevitz et al. (2011). At the end of each trading day, we count the trades that are closed at a profit (loss) as realized gain (realized loss) and the trades that are not closed at a price that is higher (lower) than the purchase price as a paper gain (paper loss). Then, the size of the disposition effect is estimated as the difference between the proportion of realized gains and the proportion of realized losses:Disposition effect = # realized gains# realized gains + # paper gains−# realized losses# realized losses + # paper lossesAn investor who sells all trades that are in-the-money at the end of the observation period and holds all trades that are out-of-the-money exhibits the maximum disposition effect of one. Conversely, an investor who only keeps positions that are in-the-money exhibits the minimum disposition effect of minus one. If the trader equally closes profitable and non-profitable positions, her disposition effect is zero.In addition to trading covariates, we generate two dummy variables based on demographic variables. Specifically, we generate a dummy variable Male that takes the value one if the investor is male, zero otherwise, and a dummy variable Young that takes the value one if the investor is 34 years or younger, zero otherwise.Summary statistics of our daily trade data are presented in Table 2. The statistics indicate that, while on average trades yield a negative return, the vast majority of trades yield positive returns. Winning trade is a dummy variable that takes value one if a trade is closed at a profit, zero otherwise. The holding period (in hours) is skewed, with many short records. We observe that investors use significant amounts of leverage, on average, which may be explained by the high fraction of trades taking place in foreign exchange. Investment is measured as a fraction of total assets deposited with the online broker and indicates that investors only invest small fractions of their assets per trade, on average. Long is a dummy variable that takes value one if a trade is a long position, zero otherwise. Investors engage almost equally in long and short positions.Summary statistics for monthly aggregated trade data, covering 145,840 investors, are shown in Table 3.

Moreover, they execute significantly more trades than other traders. Leader traders also show a significantly shorter holding period and tend to use more leverage. Regarding their performance, we observe a slightly larger performance for leaders, albeit still negative, on average. We also observe a slightly negative past performance for leader traders.Finally, Table 5 presents the distribution of the average disposition effect across gender and age ranges. Interestingly, the disposition effect is more pronounced for female investors, which is in line with previous experimental results. Similarly, we observe that the disposition effect increases with age.The disposition effect in social tradingWe begin our analysis by presenting several descriptive statistics analyzing the performance and trading behavior of the different trader types. Panel (a) of Fig. 1 displays the fractions of winning trades (N+/N+ + N-) for the different trader types. The data shows significantly more winning than losing trades, and the fraction of winning trades is highest for delegation trades (consistent with Pan et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2014) and lowest for autonomous trades. The fraction of winning trades for leader trades is lower than that for delegation traders. This has two potential explanations. First, followers may alter a position on their own after they are engaged in it. They may close the position earlier or unfollow the leader and hold the position longer. Second, followers may prefer a specific segment of leader traders. Hence, this part of the leader group is assigned a greater weight (since they have more followers). Our results underline the intuition that leaders with a higher winning percentage are followed more often, which is reflected by the higher winning percentage of delegation trades. Hence, most followers seem to be able to select the “right” investors to follow (i.e., followers seem to be able to identify specifically those investors who have a high ratio of winning trades).When considering the ROI, the situation is quite different, as can be seen in Panel (b) of Fig. 1). On average, ROI is negative except for the delegation group that exhibits significantly higher ROIs. In general, substantial differences across groups result. The graphical illustration is confirmed by a simple t-test (p < .01). Thus, although the fraction of profitable trades is higher than that of non-profitable trades, this does not necessarily lead to positive ROIs for most groups. To explain this, we separately study the ROIs of profitable (Fig. 1, Panel (c)) and unprofitable positions (Fig. 1, Panel (d)). Here, we again find significant group differences. For example, profitable advice trades exhibit the highest ROI; for losing trades, autonomous trades show the best ROI. Thus, although the likelihood of generating profitable trades is comparably high for all groups, their ROIs are, on average, not high enough to offset the losses from unprofitable trades. Overall, delegation trades significantly outperform (p < .01) autonomous, leader, and advice trades. Despite leader trades showing, on average, negative ROIs, delegation trades realize, on average, positive ROIs. This again indicates that most followers seem to be able to select the “right” investors to follow.Security holding timeThe disposition effect may depend on the average holding time of securities. The holding time, t, is defined as the difference between a position’s closing and opening time (t = tclosed − topened). Holding time distributions for positive and negative trades are calculated separately, based on their ROI. Positions exactly breaking even are excluded from the calculation.
	Here is the text with all unwanted information removed:Performance comparison of social and non-social trade types. The figure presents a comparison of the performance of different investors on a social trading platform. Panel (a) displays the fraction of profitable trades; Panel (b) displays the average ROI by trade type. The bottom figures show the average ROI for different trade types for profitable (Panel (c)) and non-profitable trades (Panel (d)).even are excluded. Across all groups, more than half of all positions are held no longer than one day. Only approx. 5% of all trades are held for longer than one month. This highlights that the network constitutes a trading rather than an investment platform.We present the holding time distributions of positive and negative trades for different trade types in Fig. 2. We observe that the holding time distributions of positive and negative trades are significantly different from one another. The graphical results are confirmed by the Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test (p < .01). On average, positive trades are held for a shorter time period than negative trades (except for holding times of less than one minute).From autonomous to leader trades, the likelihood that positive trades have a significantly shorter holding time than negative trades increases significantly. Overall, there is a clear pattern that shorter time periods are disproportionately populated by trades with a positive ROI, while the inverse is true for longer time periods.

The figure shows the holding time, t, defined as the difference between a position's closing and opening time by trade groups. The left panel (a) shows the distribution for autonomous trades and the right panel (b) shows leader trades.Hazard estimates of autonomous and leader trades. The table shows estimates of the determinants of the hazard rate to closing a position using a Cox proportional hazard model. Profitable trade is an indicator variable that equals one if a position is profitable, zero otherwise. Model (1) is restricted to autonomous trades; Model (2) is restricted to leader trades. Estimates are based on daily trade data. Standard errors are in parentheses.(1) (2)Autonomous trades Leader tradescoef odds ratio coef odds ratioProﬁtable trade 0.0456 1.05 0.461 1.586(0.00) (0.00)The disposition effectWe visualize the disposition effect by plotting the estimates of Kaplan–Meier survival functions, separately for autonomous trades and for leader trades. The Kaplan–Meier survival functions represent the cumulative densities of open trades as a function of holding time. Survival functions are based on an indicator variable that equals one if a position is closed, zero otherwise. For each plot, separate survival functions are shown, depending on whether the trades are closed at a gain or at a loss. The disposition effect is revealed whenever there are more realized gains than losses for a given holding period, i.e., whenever the survival function of the realized losses exceeds that of the realized gains. The magnitude of the gap between the survival functions measures the size of the disposition effect. Fig. 3 indicates that both autonomous and leader traders are subject to the disposition effect. Most interestingly, the disposition effect—as illustrated by the Kaplan–Meier survival functions—is more pronounced for leader traders. Hazard rate estimates from a Cox proportional hazard model, which are reported in Table 6, confirm the Kaplan–Meier estimates. Thus, this first preliminary evidence suggests that leader traders differ substantially in their trading behavior as compared to autonomous traders.To offer some preliminary insights into the effect of the number of followers on the disposition effect, we provide summary statistics of the disposition effect with respect to the number of followers in Table 7. Using monthly aggregated data, we group investors into six distinct groups depending on the number of other investors following their trading strategy. We observe a disposition effect of 0.3536 for investors who are not being followed by others. The disposition effect increases monotonically in the number of followers. For example, for investors with 100 or more followers, we observe a disposition effect of 0.4989. This indicates that the size of the audience that follows one’s investment decisions is related to one’s disposition effect. Regardless of the number of followers, female investors are always more susceptible to the disposition effect than male investors.Determinants of the probability of closing existing positionsWhat are the determinants of the probability of traders closing existing positions? As suggested by the descriptive data above, we predict that (i) winning positions are significantly more likely to be closed, and (ii) the probability of closing winning positions differs significantly between autonomous and leader traders.We use a probit model to predict the probability of closing positions. We include all positions of autonomous and leader traders that were opened and closed on different trading days in this analysis, using multiple observations per trade. We include one observation for every 24-h holding period until the position is closed. The dependent variable Close is a dummy variable taking value one on the day when a position is closed, zero otherwise. The independent variable of interest is Profitable trade. This is also a dummy variable that takes value one when the position exhibits positive paper profits, zero otherwise. To determine whether a position is winning or losing, we compare the purchase price with the closing price on each given day. More formally, we estimate the following model:P r( Close ) it = ∑ i Profitable  trade it ×Trade group i + Controls  it + ϵit , where Trade  group  denotes a dummy variable that captures the group of trades to which a specific trade belongs. Using the interaction terms with the dummy variables, we divide our explanatory variable into two distinct variables, one for autonomous and one for leader trades. For example, the variable Profitable  trade,  autonomous  trade  takes value one if the position currently exhibits positive paper profits and is an autonomous trade, zero otherwise.
	Here is the text with unwanted information removed:Fig. 3. Holding period of gains and losses for autonomous and leader traders. The figure shows the estimates of a Kaplan-Meier survival function. The estimates are based on an indicator variable that equals one if a position is closed, zero otherwise. Both figures depict separate survival functions for winning (green, strata = 1) and losing (red, strata = 0) positions. The left panel (a) shows the distribution for autonomous trades; the right panel (b) shows leader trades. The figure is based on daily trade data.Table 7Disposition effect by number of followers.

As control variables, we include a dummy variable for leader trades (autonomous trades are the baseline) and a dummy variable that captures whether the position is long or short (Long). We include month dummies to control for aggregate time-trends.Table 8 presents the models to analyze the investors’ propensity to close winning positions sooner than losing positions. Standard errors are clustered at the investor level. As standard errors in the multivariate regression framework decrease in the sample size, the dimensions of our sample will yield statistically significant results beyond conventional levels of significance. We cope with this issue by focusing on the economic significance of our results and thus present marginal effects here.We observe that profitable trades are more likely to be closed. This result holds equally for autonomous and leader trades and is consistent with the disposition effect. For autonomous trades, the probability that the position is closed on a given trading day increases by 7.0% if the position is currently profitable. This result is even more pronounced for leader trades (15.1%). In Model 2, we replace our dummy variables denoting profitable trades with a continuous variable capturing the current paper gains of an existing position. The continuous variable Profit not only captures the effect of profitable positions on the probability of closing a position but also allows us to analyze the effect depending on the size of a position’s gains or losses. This variable confirms our previous findings.In summary, the empirical evidence in this section suggests that leader traders are more susceptible to the disposition effect than investors who are not being followed.3.3. Do newly appointed leaders change their trading behavior?The descriptive data and the probit analyses above suggest that leader traders exhibit a significantly larger disposition effect than traders who are not being followed by others. We hypothesize that investors with followers become more susceptible to the bias. Generating frequent profitable positions, i.e., closing profitable positions sooner to take a small profit or ROI, signals “good performance” (in terms of winning trades percentage) to (potential) followers. Closing negative positions not only deteriorates one’s overall realized performance but can also deter (potential) followers.In the following, we thus test whether investors’ propensity for the disposition effect increases when they are followed by other traders for the first time. To identify whether leaders change their trading behavior, we analyze the changes in their trading behavior after becoming a leader.
	Here is the cleaned text of the scientific article:Table 8Probability that investors will close an existing position (marginal effects). The table reports the marginal effects of our probit regressions. The model includes multiple observations per each trade, one for every 24-h holding period until the position is closed. The dependent variable is a dummy variable taking value one if the open position is closed on a given day, zero otherwise.Profitable trade, autonomous trade is a dummy variable that takes value one if the position currently exhibits positive paper gain and is an autonomous trade, zero otherwise; Profitable trade, leader trade is a dummy variable that takes value one if the position currently exhibits positive paper gain and is a leader trade, zero otherwise; Profit, autonomous trade denotes the current paper gains and losses of autonomous trades and is zero for leader trades; Profit, leader trade denotes the current paper gains and losses of leader trades and is zero for autonomous trades; Long is a dummy variable taking value one if a trade is a long position, zero otherwise; Leader trade is a dummy variable taking value one if a trade is duplicated by other investors, zero otherwise.Standard errors are clustered at the individual investor level to mitigate possible issues due to heteroscedasticity and serial correlation. Standard errors are in parentheses. As standard errors in the multivariate regression framework decrease in the sample size, the dimensions of our sample will yield statistically significant results beyond conventional levels of significance. In light of this observation, we focus on the economic significance and present marginal effects. The table is based on all positions of autonomous and leader traders that were opened and closed on different trading days.(1) (2)Proﬁtable trade, autonomous trade 0.070(0.001)Proﬁtable trade, leader trade 0.151(0.003)Proﬁt, autonomous trade 0.026(0.004)Proﬁt, leader trade 0.355(0.029)Long −0.048 −0.039(0.001) (0.001)Leader trade −0.082 −0.056(0.002) (0.002)Observations 231,891,774 231,891,774Trader 231,708 231,708Chi 2 39,572.0 19,036.0Pseudo R 2 0.10 0.05The treatment group consists of investors who are followed by another trader for the first time. The initial dataset contains 29,297 investors who, at some point over our sample period, are followed by another trader. Note, however, that several of these investors already have had followers before our sample period begins or already have followers in the first months of our sample period. Therefore, we have to exclude these investors from the difference-in-differences analysis.We compare the disposition effect of newly appointed leaders before and after treatment (which is the event of being followed for the first time) with that of a control group. We do not include all other investors in this control group; rather, we employ a nearest-neighbor-matching approach to find traders with similar trading strategies.The table reports the results of our difference-in-differences estimations of the disposition effect of investors on the social trading platform of the month that they are followed by another trader for the first time.

The variable captures all effects that are relevant for both types of investors after the treatment. Treatment group is a dummy variable equal to one for investors in the treatment group. It controls for all time-invariant differences between the two types of investors that are not accounted for by the matching routine. The interaction term between Post treatment and Treatment group is the central term as its coefficient captures the additional disposition effect of treated investors that is related to being followed for the first time.When estimating Eq. (2), we specify that the error term, ϵ, contains a fixed effect for each investor, which is perfectly collinear with the dummy variable Treatment group. We also include time fixed effects to control for aggregate time-trends. The time effects are perfectly collinear with Post treatment. We restrict our analysis to the immediate trading activity of investors around the treatment date to mitigate other time-varying inﬂuences on investors’ trading activity.In our baseline difference-in-differences estimation, we control for investors’ trading activity with their monthly number of trades, average leverage, average holding period, the diversification dummy, number of instruments, the number of followed traders, and investors’ performance with their average ROI. Table 9 presents the results. The coefficient on the treatment is positive and significantly different from zero, both statistically and economically (Model 1). This suggests that investors are indeed more susceptible to the disposition effect when they are first followed by other investors.
	Here is the text without unwanted information:investors. After being followed for the first time, investors become less likely to close losing positions; their disposition effect increases. Since our descriptive analysis suggests that male and young investors may be less susceptible to the disposition effect, we additionally study how these investor types are affected when they become first-time leaders. Results suggest that neither male nor young investors seem to be particularly affected when being first followed (Model 2 and Model 3).In this section, we are interested in the role that followers may play when leader traders decide to close positions. We hypothesize that leaders are more concerned about closing a losing position when they have a large number of followers. For example, leader traders may be especially reluctant to close losing positions when they have a large audience (i.e., a large number of followers), given that the realization of negative profits signals a poor investment decision to (potential) followers. By maintaining a losing position, the leader does not admit having made an incorrect investment decision. Admitting a mistake is especially painful when a large group of investors follows one's trading strategy. If investors were indeed concerned about their reputation when being closely observed by others, we would expect this concern to increase in their number of followers. Leaders with many followers may be even more likely to hold losing positions open for longer, still hoping for positive returns. In other words, leader traders may be more susceptible to the disposition effect with an increasing audience. Our descriptive analysis supports this notion and suggests that investors with more followers are more susceptible to the disposition effect.The analysis is based on those traders who are leaders at some point over our sample period. We use log(1+ No. follower) to quantify the size of the audience of investors to consider that one additional follower likely has a larger impact on the behavior of an investor when the additional follower is the third or tenth follower rather than when the additional follower is the 105th follower or 500th follower. We perform a fixed-effects panel regression analysis. In other words, we exploit the within-variation in our monthly leader data to further expose the effect of having followers on an investor's disposition effect while controlling for other trading characteristics. In addition, we include month-fixed effects to control for aggregate time-trends. Results of the fixed-effects panel regression analysis are reported in Table 10.Model (1) only considers the correlation between the number of followers and the disposition effect. We observe a significantly positive coeﬃcient on Follower. This is in line with our expectations and the results of the summary statistics reported in Table 7. The disposition effect increases in the number of followers that duplicate an investor's trading strategies. Model (2) also controls for the fraction of winning trades the investor realized in the previous month. We still observe a statistically significant correlation between Follower and the disposition effect. Moreover, we also find a positive correlation between the fraction of winning trades and the disposition effect. Next, Model (3) includes additional trading and performance characteristics of the investor. While the coeﬃcient on Follower slightly decreases in size from Model (1) to Model (3), we nonetheless observe a significantly positive correlation between the number of followers and the disposition effect. Finally, in Model (4) we include a series of dummy variables to estimate the impact of followers on the disposition effect of leader traders. Specifically, we include a dummy variable for each of the different categories used in Table 7, where the category with zero followers is our baseline. Thus, we include a dummy variable Follower1 that takes a value of one if the investor has one follower, zero otherwise; a dummy variable Follower2-4 that takes a value of one if the investor has two to four followers, zero otherwise; etc. Similar to Table 7, our regression analysis indicates that the disposition effect significantly increases with the audience of an investor. This provides further evidence in support of our hypothesis that leader traders' decisions are influenced by a large audience. The disposition effect significantly increases in the number of followers.
	Here is the text with all unwanted information removed:Disposition effect of delegation traders. The figure shows the distribution of the disposition effect of delegation traders. The left panel (a) shows the distribution for all trades that delegation traders executed over our sample period. That is, the distribution includes trades based on their own trading behavior and trades based on the delegation of investment decisions to a leader trader; the right panel (b) includes only trades that reflect delegation traders' own trading behavior.Our results above suggest that leader traders are more susceptible to the disposition effect than are autonomous traders, which is in line with our hypothesis that investors who become leaders also become more susceptible to the disposition effect. However, our results may also be driven by a selection bias. In particular, leaders could be investors most prone to the disposition effect. They may rarely sell capital losses and mainly sell capital gains as a result of their individual investor characteristics. These trading characteristics may attract myopic delegation traders.We address this issue here by studying the trading behavior of delegation and advice traders. Delegation traders delegate some part of their investment strategies to leaders. Advice traders manually copy investment strategies of leaders. However, (most) delegation and advice traders also execute some trades on their own. If these trader types indeed favor disposition-effect-related trading strategies, this should also be reflected in their own behavior, i.e., in the investment strategies which are not a result of duplication strategies.First, we estimate the disposition effect of all trades that are executed by delegation and advice traders. The distribution of the disposition effect of these traders is shown in Panel (a) of Fig. 4. The mean disposition effect of all trades that are executed by delegation and advice traders is 0.439. Then, we estimate the disposition effect of delegation and advice traders' own trading strategies. To be specific, we only use data on individual trades of delegation and advice traders that are not duplicating any trades of others. For these trades, neither reputational concerns nor responsibility are an issue, and we should observe significantly lower susceptibility to the disposition effect. The distribution of the disposition effect of these trades is shown in Panel (b) of Fig. 4. The mean disposition effect of delegation and advice traders' own trading behavior is 0.1. This is significantly lower than the disposition effect of all trades of delegation and advice traders. We use a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to compare the two samples and reject the null hypothesis that the samples are drawn from the same distribution (test statistic: D = 0.474, p-value = 0.0). These results thus support the notion that delegation and advice traders are not attracted by disposition-effect trading strategies.The fact that delegation and advice traders display a very small disposition effect may be explained as follows: Investors who come to the platform to rely on the advice of other traders may have different motivations from investors who come to the platform to trade on their own or to become leaders. Therefore, these traders may actually be the least concerned with their reputation, which explains their low susceptibility towards the disposition effect.As a second approach to test for a potential selection bias, we study how followers select leader traders to follow. Pelster (2017) and Röder and Walter (2017) document that in social trading portfolios, the likelihood of adopting the strategy of another investor is momentum-driven and increases with the other investor's past returns. Moreover, Pelster (2017) shows that the likelihood of increasing one's audience is significantly correlated with one's past return variance. This is consistent with social transmission bias (see Han et al., 2017). If our results were driven by a selection bias, the probability of increasing one's audience would also be explained by the disposition effect.To study the selection of leader traders, we additionally estimate probit regression models using our monthly aggregated data. First, we estimate models using a dummy variable that takes value one if the investor is first targeted as an investment advisor (becomes a leader for the first time), zero otherwise, as our dependent variable. As explanatory variables, we include an investor's disposition effect as well as variables that control for trading behavior. Explanatory variables are lagged by one period. The marginal effects of our estimations are shown in the first three columns of Table 11. While the coefficient on the disposition effect is significantly different from zero, the reported marginal effects are very small. In fact, the probability that an investor becomes a leader for the first time increases by less than one percent for a one-standard-deviation increase in his or her disposition effect.
	Here is the cleaned-up text without unwanted information:Table 11Probability that investors will increase their audience (marginal effects). The table reports the marginal effects of our probit regressions. In the first three columns, the dependent variable is a dummy variable taking value one if the investor becomes a leader for the first time, zero otherwise. In the final three columns, the dependent variable is a dummy variable taking value one if the investor increases her audience in a given month, zero otherwise.Variable definitions on investors’ trading activity can be found in Table 3. t-statistics are reported in parentheses.

We include the same lagged independent variables as before. Again, we observe a statistically significant coefficient on the disposition effect with a very small marginal effect. Instead, our results are in line with previous literature (Pelster, 2017) and indicate that followers select leader traders primarily based on their past performance.We conclude that being more susceptible to the disposition effect does not meaningfully increase a trader's likelihood of gaining additional followers. This suggests that our results are not driven by a selection bias.3.6. The disposition effect and investor experiencePrevious studies on investor biases show that investors who trade more frequently and are more experienced are less affected by biases such as the disposition effect (see, e.g., Da Costa et al., 2013). Moreover, experimental evidence by Hermann et al. (2017) suggests that especially inexperienced investors with a higher degree of social-value orientation exhibit a larger disposition effect when deciding on behalf of others. In this section, we analyze the impact of investor experience on the leader traders' disposition effect.In order to distinguish between experienced and inexperienced traders, we first calculate an investor's experience in each month as the time difference between the current month and the month of the first-observed trading activity in our sample period. We then split the sample at the median value and create a dummy variable Inexperience that takes a value of one if the investor has below median experience, zero otherwise.Table 12Inexperienced leaders and the disposition effect. The table shows mean and standard deviation of the disposition effect from Table 3 with respect to the number of followers separated by investor experience. We split our sample at the median value for investor experience. Inexperience is a dummy variable that takes a value of one if the investor has below median experience, zero otherwise. n denotes the number of investor-month.Follower  Inexperience  Mean  SD  n0 0 0.3376 0.3426 74,9871 0.3703 0.3253 720,9041 0 0.4085 0.3139 31,0881 0.4260 0.2957 30,0532-4 0 0.4283 0.3116 15,7861 0.4692 0.2889 11,5135-7 0 0.4371 0.3060 4,1021 0.4754 0.2929 2,4458-99 0 0.4492 0.3034 9,7091 0.4959 0.2930 4,843>=99 0 0.4896 0.2908 3,3381 0.5295 0.2770 1,012We observe a larger disposition effect for inexperienced traders across the board.To analyze whether investor experience also moderates the impact of an investor being followed for the first time, we repeat our difference-in-differences analysis and include Inexperience as an additional variable.
	Here is the extracted text without unwanted information:Additional control variable as well as in an interaction term. However, while Table 12 indicates that the disposition effect is larger for inexperienced investors in general, we do not find any statistically significant effect of Inexperience on our treatment, i.e., the event that an investor becomes a leader for the first time. The coefficient on the interaction term in our difference-in-differences analysis is not statistically different from zero. We do not tabulate these results here in order to preserve space.FX investors vs. stock market investorsIt seems noteworthy that foreign exchange securities represent the major part of the data, and thus, our conclusions might largely be valid for these investment strategies only. Note, that foreign exchange trades represent a significant part of trades worldwide. As discussed in the literature, foreign exchange and equity markets are fundamentally different from one another. For example, Locke and Mann (2005) note that the trading speed and position size in equity and foreign exchange markets differ significantly. Consequently, foreign exchange investors may follow different investment patterns than stock market investors. This is supported by O’Connell and Teo (2009), who show that investors in foreign exchange markets close their positions much more quickly if they display paper losses. In a related contribution, ter Ellen et al. (2017) find evidence for behavioral heterogeneity in several asset classes but not in equities. For example, foreign exchange traders view private information as an important feature of their market (King et al., 2013), and the feeling of having private information in social interactions and other investor emotions have been shown to be decisive factors in financial decision-making processes (see, for instance, Au et al., 2003).We repeat our analyses with separate subsamples, first including only those investors with a focus on foreign exchange trading and second including only investors with a focus on stock market trading. Our results suggest that—with regard to the relation between the number of followers and the disposition effect—no notable differences between foreign exchange and stock market investors exist. We do not tabulate these results here in order to preserve space.This article studies the relationship between financial advice givers and the disposition effect in a social trading environment. A large and unique dataset allows us to study the trading behavior of different trader types in such an environment. Our results suggest a significant correlation between the number of investors copying trading strategies of others and the manifestation of their disposition effect. Traders with many followers are less likely to close losing positions. We use a difference-in-differences analysis to study behavioral changes in investment decisions when investors become leaders, i.e., are being followed by others for the first time. We find that investors significantly increase their disposition effect as a response to this event. This finding holds true for investors who engage in foreign exchange trading and for traders of stocks and stock market indices.Showing further that delegation and advice traders do not seem to be particularly attracted to the disposition effect, we provide evidence that our findings are not the result of a selection bias. An interesting finding is that, regardless of the number of followers, female investors are always more susceptible to the disposition effect than male investors.Traders’ reputational concerns may influence their trading behavior. It may be that leaders feel responsible for their followers and hence feel an urge to not fail them. This behavior may be driven by fear of losing followers when publicly admitting a bad investment decision. Alternatively, it may represent an attempt by newly appointed leaders to manage their social image and/or self-image and signal confidence in their initial investment strategy.This article demonstrates that advice seekers may need to monitor newly appointed advisors closely, as advisors may change their investment behavior. The observed investment activities before the leader-follower relationship is established are no guarantee that similar investment behavior will follow in the future. Previous activities do not account for possible changes in behavioral biases after an investor is followed for the first time.This paper further suggests that newly appointed investment advisors should attempt to uncouple from their biases. Once they have an understanding that they tend to be susceptible to a more pronounced bias, this effect could be addressed. Awareness of these insights from risk psychology and behavioral finance may considerably improve the efficiency and rationality of financial advisors acting in an interdependent network. Our study highlights the importance of understanding behavioral biases when offering financial advice.Regarding the behavioral finance literature, our study expands current research by Rau (2015), Heimer (2016), and Hermann et al. (2017) who show that investors exhibit a larger disposition effect in social environments. More precisely, while Rau (2015) shows that the disposition effect is higher in team decisions, Heimer (2016) provides empirical evidence that investors’ disposition effect increases when they begin to trade open to the public. This paper shows that this tendency increases even more when investors become signal providers in a transparent trading environment and are accepted as peer-to-peer advisors. These findings are underlined by the recent experimental study of Hermann et al. (2017) who find that especially pro-social inexperienced investors display a higher disposition effect when trading on behalf of others.We offer a possible explanation to reconcile these conflicting results: Each brokerage service utilizes a unique design for its website, and the organization of information may be different across brokerage services, different information may be highlighted, or different colors may be used to highlight information. Since the way individuals react to a particular choice is different depending on how that choice is presented to them (Tversky and Kahneman, 1981), the partly contradicting evidence between the different archival studies may be explained by different methods of framing information. In particular, the framing of the trading platform may influence how exactly investors try to manage their social and self-image. As the social trading platform analyzed in this paper displays investors’ fraction of winning trades rather prominently on investors’ profile pages, investors may aim to increase their fraction of winning trades in order to manage their impression. They can do so by closing winning trades early and holding on to losing trades longer—I.e., they display a large disposition effect. Only if brokerage services represented the different choices to their traders in the same way, equal decision-making should be expected. As a consequence, future research should study how the framing of social trading decisions serves as a mediator for the influence social interaction exerts on investors’ trading behavior.

	Here is the cleaned text without unwanted information:Mobile Devices and Investment News Apps: The Effects of Information Release, Push Notification, and the Fear of Missing OutWe examine how information dissemination via mobile device applications (apps) affects nonprofessional investors' judgments. In response to the prevalence of mobile device use, the media ungroups content into smaller pieces to accommodate users, and apps use push notifications to highlight this content. These changes increase users' ability to access investment information in real time, leaving some investors feeling as if they are missing out if they are not continuously connected. We validate a scale to capture investors' fear of missing out on investment information (I-FoMO) and document that I-FoMO is distinct from traditional FoMO that occurs in social settings. Then, using an experiment, we find that receiving ungrouped content via a mobile device has a greater effect on investment allocations in the presence, rather than absence, of push notifications. Further, we find that these results hold for higher, but not for lower, I-FoMO investors.Keywords: investment apps; mobile communication; push notifications; fear of missing out; information release

INTRODUCTIONAdvances in technology have resulted in important changes to the way that investors receive, and the media disseminates, investment information. For example, recent survey data indicates that 65 percent of investors between the ages of 35 and 54 with online brokerage accounts now believe that it is critical to be able to monitor their investments via mobile applications (apps), and 43 percent of these investors report that they frequently read financial news on a mobile device. The numbers are even higher among investors between the ages of 25 and 34, where 72 percent monitor investments and 60 percent read financial news via apps. In response, news agencies increasingly ungroup news content by breaking it into smaller pieces to optimize content for mobile delivery. Further, to capture users’ attention, news apps often use push notification technology, which alerts users to news as soon as it becomes available instead of requiring users to check the app for updates. These practices decrease the length, but increase the number, of individual news releases that users receive.As a result of the expanding role of mobile devices in investment news consumption and the media’s response to this change, investors now have increased access to real-time investment information. While this is beneficial in that it has improved information flow for individual investors, it is not without consequences. In this paper, we contend that the dissemination of information via mobile apps causes some users to feel as if they could be “missing out” on investment information if they are not continuously connected. Indeed, financial commentators have suggested that the fear of missing out on investment information is an important force in investment settings. Despite speculation about the importance of this phenomenon, to date there has been no systematic way to study its existence or related effects.
	Here is the cleaned-up text, removing unwanted artefacts and information:The purpose of our research is to examine how ungrouped content, push notifications, and the fear of missing out on investment information interact to affect individual investors' investment decisions. Investigating this issue is important because the media's role in information dissemination is critical to the capital markets. For example, media dissemination can reduce information asymmetry, affect trading behavior, reduce cash flow mispricing, and improve market pricing efficiency.Combined, this literature supports the idea that investors attend to the information disseminated by the media, even when the media is simply repeating the information provided by a firm. If the manner in which media outlets package information affects how investors interpret that information, then these choices have potential economic consequences for investors. Further, if there is a systematic difference in the extent to which some investors respond to these dissemination changes, then it is useful to have a method for capturing that difference and understanding its effects in investment settings.To address these issues, we examine how the fear of missing out on investment information, which we refer to as I-FoMO, is distinct from the cultural phenomenon in which individuals fear missing out on rewarding social experiences (traditional FoMO). We use a controlled experiment to examine how I-FoMO interacts with push notifications and ungrouped content to affect non-professional investors' judgments. We draw on prior marketing literature to develop predictions about how investors will evaluate the shorter, more frequent information releases that occur as a result of mobile technology.
	Here is the text with all unwanted information removed:more pieces affects how it is evaluated because the breaks between the pieces capture users’ attention, thereby stimulating their curiosity (Kupor and Tormala 2015) and intensifying their experience (Nelson and Meyvis 2008). For example, users who receive positive information think that this information is more favorable if they receive it in smaller pieces, with breaks in between, than if they receive it all at once.In a mobile device setting, the presence of push notifications determines whether users view news releases as relatively more or less grouped because these notifications alert users to information delivery as it occurs. When push notifications highlight positive news, investors are more likely to process each release as it arrives, meaning that investors will respond more favorably to the shorter, ungrouped releases than to the longer, grouped releases. Without push notifications, investors are more likely to process multiple releases at the same time, meaning that grouping versus ungrouping will have less of an effect on investors’ judgments.Accordingly, we predict an interaction whereby ungrouped information has a greater effect on investment allocations in the presence of push notifications than in the absence of these notifications. Further, we expect that higher I-FoMO individuals, who are more concerned with receiving investment information, will be more sensitive to the combined effects of information ungrouping and push notification.To test our predictions, our experiment provides nonprofessional investors with a software-based “virtual iPhone.” The phone includes an investment news app that provides firm-related news releases. We hold constant the total amount of information provided to participants, but manipulate the number of news releases. An ungrouped (grouped) release breaks the information out over six (two) disclosures. We also manipulate whether participants receive push notifications highlighting the news releases.
	Here is the text without unwanted information and artefacts:receive push notifications that alert them to these releases. In the notification-present conditions, participants receive a banner alert each time a news release appears. In the notification-absent conditions, participants must look at the news app to learn that a news release is available. After accessing all news items, participants provide an investment allocation. We then measure individual I-FoMO levels with a scale that we develop and validate.Consistent with our predictions, we find an interaction between information ungrouping and the presence of push notifications. Examining the interaction with respect to relative levels of I-FoMO, we find that this interaction holds for those who exhibit higher I-FoMO but not for those who exhibit lower I-FoMO. Our results are consistent with the idea that ungrouped content and push notifications have stronger effects on investors who are particularly concerned with missing out on investment information that can result in higher economic returns.Process data from the experiment provides additional insights. Relative to lower I-FoMO individuals, those with higher I-FoMO open the news app and check the home screen more frequently, looking for an indication of new investment news. Finally, we rule out alternative explanations for our results by documenting that those who are higher in I-FoMO do not differ from those who are lower in I-FoMO with respect to distractibility or level of education. Thus, I-FoMO seems to affect information search behavior rather than information processing behavior. Our results highlight both the effects of mobile technology features on investment judgments and the importance of I-FoMO to investment behavior.Our research contributes to the voluntary disclosure literature that investigates the media’s role as an information intermediary in financial markets. The media can serve at least three distinct purposes – (1) disseminating information through additional channels, (2) synthesizing information from multiple sources (without any additional interpretation), and (3) creating
	Here is the text of the original scientific article, with all unwanted information and artefacts removed:Information through investigation and interpretation (Bushee et al. 2010). In contrast to research that has investigated the media's role in synthesizing information (e.g., Blankespoor, deHaan, and Zhu 2018) or creating information (e.g., Guest 2018), we focus on the media's role in disseminating information (e.g., Bushee et al. 2010; Twedt 2016). Unlike prior research, which has examined the effects of increased access to information via media dissemination, we hold constant the total amount of information and examine how technological advances that accompany media dissemination can affect investor judgment.In particular, we focus on the media's optimization of content for mobile delivery and the prevalence of push notifications. Inasmuch as media outlets continue to repurpose content into smaller stand-alone pieces and develop new notification technologies to increase user engagement, our results illustrate the effects of these trends on investment judgments. These findings have implications for related settings in which information releases may vary in their length and delivery mechanism (e.g., Blankespoor et al. 2018). In general, our results suggest that the increasing use of RSS feeds, email alerts, and text alerts for information delivery may have significant effects on investors' reactions to that information. More broadly, our research contributes to the literature that examines how individuals find it difficult to ignore interruptions (e.g., Basoglu, Fuller, and Sweeney 2009).Our research also makes an important methodological contribution to the literature. Although there is a validated scale for measuring traditional FOMO in social settings (Przybylski et al. 2013), there has not been a method for capturing the fear of missing out on investment information, despite speculation as to the importance of this construct in investment settings. Accordingly, we develop a psychometric scale that is tailored to the measurement of I-FoMO. Although our research examines the effects of I-FoMO on the behavior of nonprofessional investors, we believe that our findings have implications for professional investors as well.
	Here is the cleaned text, removing unwanted information such as line numbers, authors list, information about the editor or references list:investors, hedge fund managers worry that I-FoMO may also affect professional analysts’ behavior (Schüür 2017). Future research could examine this possibility. Finally, our research has important practical implications for investors. If news outlets continue to optimize news for mobile delivery by providing shorter, more frequent releases, our results indicate that this choice can affect investors due to the prevalence of push notification technology on mobile devices. This is particularly the case for those who have a greater fear of missing out on investment information. Investors who use mobile devices for investment-related activities may wish to consider whether these devices are beneficial to their investment goals. Ironically, it may be difficult for higher I-FoMO individuals to make this determination, despite the fact that push notifications have the greatest effect on these individuals.We organize the remainder of the paper as follows. The next section provides background information. Section III describes our I-FoMO scale development procedures. Section IV develops our predictions, Section V describes the experiment used to test these predictions, and Section VI reports the results. Section VII concludes and discusses the implications of our work.Mobile Technology and Investment InformationThe use of mobile devices in the United States is pervasive. The Federal Reserve Board found that 87 percent of the U.S. adult population has a mobile phone, and 71 percent of mobile phones are internet-enabled smartphones. On average, users pick up their smartphone 100 times per day and spend 26 percent of their time looking at the home screen. Similarly, the Pew Research Center reports that 67 percent of mobile users find themselves checking their phones for messages, alerts, or calls, even when the phone has not been ringing or vibrating.
	Here is the extracted text without unwanted artefacts and information:Mobile devices serve as an information conduit between news sources and users, as individuals use mobile apps to keep up with breaking news. The Pew Research Center reports that 68 percent of smartphone owners use their phone to follow news events. With respect to financial news, both traditional news outlets, such as the Wall Street Journal and CNBC, and large brokerages, including Charles Schwab, TD Ameritrade, Vanguard, Fidelity, and E*Trade, offer mobile apps that provide access to company news. Indeed, one of the appeals of mobile technology is that it can serve as an always-on conduit for investment information and this information is essential for generating economic returns. However, the potential downside of this attachment to technology is that certain individuals may experience greater apprehension at the thought of missing information.Fear of Missing Out on Investment Information (I-FoMO)The fear of missing out (FoMO) is a pervasive apprehension that others might be having rewarding social experiences from which one is absent. FoMO has become a ubiquitous part of our culture as a result of the sharp increase in mobile technology and social media. That is, mobile technology makes it easier for individuals to be aware of social events and may cause individuals to feel anxious when they “miss out” on these events. FoMO is also an established personality trait that is grounded in psychology theory. According to this theory, there is variation in the extent to which individuals exhibit FoMO.While the term ‘FoMO’ applies to social contexts, concerns about the fear of missing out have started appearing more frequently in investment contexts. For example, investment blogs often argue that the fear of missing out is an important determinant of individuals’ investment behavior. In these contexts, the focus is on the fear of missing out on investment information.
	Here is the cleaned text of the scientific article:missing information that could move prices (and result in trading gains for the individual) rather than on the fear of missing a rewarding social experience. Not only can I-FoMO affect retail investors, but experienced hedge fund managers also recognize the potential for investment-related FoMO to play a role in the financial markets by affecting analysts’ information evaluation strategies (Schüür 2017). Even with this attention from both nonprofessional investors and Wall Street, the fear of missing out on investment information has yet to be studied systematically in the financial reporting literature. Thus, to date, there is no evidence as to whether investment-related FoMO (I-FoMO) exists, is different than traditional FoMO, or whether it can affect investors’ judgments. Providing evidence with respect to these issues requires the development of a scale that can capture the I-FoMO construct.I-FoMO is conceptually related to the more traditional notion of FoMO in that both are driven by an individual’s concern for losing an opportunity to realize a positive outcome. However, with I-FoMO the potential reward is monetary, whereas with traditional FoMO the potential reward is psychological well-being. This difference is consequential, as individuals who miss out on a rewarding social experience cannot simply substitute a rewarding monetary experience (Kahneman and Deaton 2010). Furthermore, individuals who experience traditional FoMO may not necessarily experience I-FoMO because those who place a high value on social experiences do not necessarily place a high value on monetary experiences (Kasser and Ryan 1993). Accordingly, we investigate whether there is an important distinction between I-FoMO in investment settings and FoMO in popular culture by developing and validating an I-FoMO scale, and then testing its effects on investment decisions.
	Here is the text without unwanted information and artefacts:III. SCALE DEVELOPMENTTo develop an I-FoMO scale, we follow the multi-step approach outlined by Hinkin (1995, 1998). We begin with the ten-item scale that Przybylski et al. (2013) established to capture the fear of missing out (FoMO) on rewarding social activities. We adapt this scale to our setting by creating 34 candidate I-FoMO scale items that reflect concern about missing out on investment-related information.Content ValidityTo assess the content validity of the candidate scale items, we sequentially present both the original FoMO scale items and our candidate I-FoMO items, randomized together, to four Ph.D. student raters who are not familiar with this research project. Raters indicate whether each item relates to the “Fear of missing out on investment information,” “Fear of missing out on social engagements,” or “Other/neither.” As the amount of agreement among raters increases for a given item, it indicates that the item has better content validity. Of the 34 candidate items, there are 23 items that at least 75 percent of the raters categorize as related to the fear of missing out on investment information (I-FoMO). Accordingly, we conclude that these 23 items have adequate content validity and retain these items for further consideration. We list these items, as well as the original FoMO scale items, in Table 1.Discriminant ValidityNext, we use multiple approaches to assess the discriminant validity of our proposed I-FoMO scale items vis-à-vis the established FoMO scale items. First, we note that our raters do not differentiate between the original FoMO scale items and our candidate I-FoMO scale items, suggesting that the two scales are highly related. We also conduct a principal component analysis to identify the underlying factors of the two scales. The results indicate that the two scales are highly correlated, with a correlation coefficient of 0.85. Therefore, we conclude that our proposed I-FoMO scale has adequate discriminant validity.Note: The table and references cited in the original text have been removed, as per your request.
	Here is the extracted text without unwanted artefacts and information:We classify any of the FoMO scale items as I-FoMO scale items, or vice-versa. Second, we administer the 23 I-FoMO scale items and the ten traditional FoMO scale items to a sample of 301 individuals recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk. Participants rate the extent to which each item describes their experiences on five-point scales that range from “not at all true of me” to “extremely true of me.” We then use parallel analysis (Horn 1965) to assess our prediction that I-FoMO scale items and FoMO scale items will cleanly load on distinct factors and that no other significant factors are present. We find that there are a maximum of three potential factors.Following the suggestion of Zwick and Velicer (1986), we combine the parallel analysis results, examination of the scree plot, and consideration of our underlying theory in determining the number of factors to retain. While our parallel analysis suggests a maximum of three factors, both examination of the scree plot and our theory imply the retention of two factors. Looking at these results together, we determine a two-factor solution is most appropriate. Next, we conduct a factor analysis with oblimin rotation to examine factor loadings and cross-loadings. The two factors have eigenvalues of 13.09 and 3.86, respectively. We report rotated factor loadings for all 23 candidate items in our I-FoMO scale in Table 1, Section A. All 23 candidate items load on Factor 1 and all ten items from the established FoMO scale load on Factor 2. No items, from either scale, load on a third factor.
	Here is the cleaned text, removing unwanted information such as line numbers, authors list, information about the editor or references list:either scale, exhibit cross-loading above the 0.40 cutoff noted by Hatcher. Thus, our evidence suggests that the FoMO and I-FoMO scale are indeed capturing distinct constructs.Scale Reduction and Reduced Scale ValidationTo combat scale fatigue, and to remain consistent with the length of the original FoMO scale, we further reduce these 23 items to a ten-item scale. We use a two-parameter Item Response Theory (IRT) model to determine the scale items that effectively capture the I-FoMO construct, and yet still discriminate between higher and lower levels of I-FoMO.This technique captures these competing characteristics of our candidate items by examining two metrics: the information parameter and the discrimination parameter. We use both parameters to determine which items should be retained in our scale so that it reliably captures the underlying trait. We retain the ten items that have the highest scores for each of these parameters.We report factor loadings, item discrimination, and item information in Table 1 for each of our candidate items. Finally, we conduct a confirmatory factor analysis with the reduced scale. As reported in Table 1, the ten items that we retain continue to have high factor loadings. Further, coefficient alpha for our final ten-item scale is 0.95, indicating excellent scale reliability.We use this ten-item scale to assess the degree of I-FoMO by computing a factor score for each individual.The information parameter, also known as the area under the item information curve (AUC), captures the degree to which the item provides information about the level of I-FoMO of a participant. The discrimination parameter tells us how effectively each item can distinguish between lower versus higher levels of I-FoMO.The correlation between the traditional FoMO scale and our I-FoMO scale is 0.31, implying relatively low overlap between the scales. This is consistent with our tests for divergent validity above. However, it is also important to note that although traditional FoMO and I-FoMO appear to be conceptually distinct, this does not mean that they are mutually exclusive. That is, an individual with higher traditional FoMO could also have higher or lower I-FoMO, because the two scales capture distinct aspects of an individual’s personality.
	Here is the text with unwanted artefacts and information removed:Given our ability to capture differences between lower and higher I-FoMO individuals, we now develop expectations about how these individuals will respond to differences in information release and push notification when using mobile devices to acquire investment information.Effects of Information Release and Push Notifications on Investment AllocationsMobile device apps have quickly become the main way for individuals to access information online and there is fierce competition among news agencies to capture the attention of these individuals. To build loyalty with readers, the news media has made at least two important changes to mobile device information delivery. First, in response to the increased use of mobile devices to access information, news sources now modify the format of information content to optimize it for mobile delivery. Namely, users are more likely to receive shorter information releases that are easier to read on mobile screens. These releases necessarily contain “ungrouped” content in that shorter releases cannot contain as much information as longer releases. Thus, publishing the additional content would require an additional release. This trend toward shorter, ungrouped disclosures may have important implications for how investors make judgments in response to investment news.We base our predictions on the consumer products literature, which examines the effects of ungrouping on individual judgments. This literature finds that even when total information is held constant, grouping versus ungrouping information affects how it is evaluated. Ungrouped information is advantageous for the news agencies because it results in a greater view count – a key performance metric for news agencies, which results in additional advertising revenue.
	Here is the text with unwanted information removed:Information is separated into more pieces than grouped information and the breaks between these pieces of information attract recipients' attention, thereby increasing their curiosity (Kupor and Tormala 2015) and intensifying their experience (Nelson and Meyvis 2008). As a result, information is more persuasive if it is ungrouped (Kupor and Tormala 2015). Thus, in the case of positive news, users view ungrouped information more favorably than grouped information (Nelson, Meyvis, and Galak 2009; Redden 2008). Further, users who receive ungrouped (rather than grouped) information express a greater willingness to pay for consumer products (Kupor and Tormala 2015; Nelson and Meyvis 2008).Applying this research to our accounting setting suggests that if the news media ungroups news releases into smaller pieces to accommodate mobile users, investors will receive more of these smaller releases and these releases will attract more attention from investors. As a result, investors are likely to respond more strongly to these news releases than they would have if the media had provided the same information in fewer, longer releases. If all of these releases provide positive firm news, then the stronger response to ungrouped content will manifest in more favorable reactions to the information and a willingness to invest more in the firm.Of course, our setting is distinct from that of the marketing literature in that news apps may use push notifications to alert users to the availability of information releases. As competition increases among news agencies, so too does the use of push notifications. These messages pop up over the content on a smartphone's screen, capture users' attention, and alert users to the arrival of new information in real-time, regardless of whether an app is open or not.
	Here is the cleaned text without unwanted artefacts and information:users’ attention. These notifications have the potential to affect whether users view information releases as relatively more or less grouped because they highlight information delivery. Market researchers have found that in the presence of push notifications, users access apps more frequently, either by directly clicking on the push notification banner or by separately opening the app in response to a recent push notification, with some research indicating that users are up to 50 percent more likely to access news-related apps in response to push notifications. As a result, investors who receive push notifications are more likely to process news releases individually as they occur whereas those who do not receive push notifications are more likely to process multiple news releases at the same time. Thus, the effects of ungrouped (versus grouped) information releases on investor judgments should be larger when accompanied by push notifications, but should be smaller in the absence of push notifications.Taken together, we expect that ungrouping versus grouping information will have a greater effect on investor allocation decisions when push notifications are present because push notifications highlight this difference in information release and encourage users to process these releases as they occur, leading to more favorable evaluations of the information when news is positive. In contrast, ungrouping versus grouping information will have less of an effect on investor allocation decisions when push notifications are absent because investors will be less aware of each information release and will be more likely to read multiple releases at the same time, thereby reducing the effects of information ungrouping.We formally state our predicted interaction:Some mobile applications require users to opt-in before receiving push notifications, whereas others automatically opt-in users and users must opt-out if they no longer want to receive push notifications. Users are particularly likely to allow push notifications for breaking news alerts, and business apps have a median opt-in rate of 54 percent according to industry research.
	Here is the text with all unwanted information removed:H1: The effect of ungrouped versus grouped news information on investors’ investment allocations is greater when push notifications are present than when they are absent.Beyond the overall interaction that we predict in H1, differences in individuals’ personality traits can also determine the extent to which information ungrouping affects individuals’ judgments (Kupor and Tormala 2015; Nelson et al. 2009). In our setting, we investigate I-FoMO as a specific personality trait that could moderate H1. As described in Section III and shown in Table 1, the items included in the final I-FoMO scale capture individuals’ propensity to experience negative emotions (i.e., fear, worry, bother, and anxiousness) at the thought of missing out on investment information. Accordingly, we expect that higher I-FoMO individuals, who are most concerned with receiving investment information, will be most affected by differences in the delivery of that information. Thus, we expect that the pattern of results that we predict in H1 will be stronger for those who are higher in I-FoMO than for those who are lower in I-FoMO. We state this formally in the hypothesis below:H2: The interactive effect of push notification and news release ungrouping is greater for individuals higher in I-FoMO than for those who are lower in I-FoMO.In sum, we predict that ungrouped information has a greater effect on investment allocations in the presence of push notifications, and we predict that higher and lower levels of I-FoMO moderate this effect such that it is greater for individuals with higher I-FoMO. An alternative possibility, which provides tension for our hypotheses, is that the convenience of mobile devices in investment settings provides individuals with both the ability and desire to acquire and process investment news regardless of whether it is ungrouped or accompanied by a push notification. If this is the case, then we would not observe differences in judgment regardless of individuals’ level of I-FoMO. Below we describe the experiment that we use to test our predictions.
	Here is the extracted text with unwanted information removed:V. EXPERIMENTParticipants and Design OverviewWe recruit 230 participants from Amazon Mechanical Turk to serve as nonprofessional investors in our experiment and obtain 178 useable responses. Study participants have an average age of 35.71 years and average work experience of 14.04 years. Participants have taken an average of 2.52 accounting courses, and 87 percent have either purchased or plan to purchase stocks and/or mutual funds. On average, participants complete the task in 18.04 minutes. As compensation, participants receive $2.00 and, as described more fully below, have the opportunity to be entered into two drawings for additional $15 bonuses.Our experiment includes three independent variables. First, we manipulate the form of information release and the presence or absence of push notifications in a 2 × 2 between-participants design. We randomly assign participants to one of these four conditions. Further, for all participants, we measure I-FoMO using the scale described in Section III. Participants complete the experiment in Qualtrics using a “virtual iPhone” that includes two apps, as described below. Screenshots of the virtual iPhone appear in Appendix 1.Instructions and ProceduresBefore beginning the experiment, we ask participants to complete a sound test to confirm that they can hear computer audio. This requirement is important for participants who receive push notifications, which are accompanied by an audible “ding.” Participants receive general task instructions and then proceed to complete the experiment.Note: The footnote at the bottom of the original text has been removed, as it is not part of the main text of the article.
	Here is the extracted text without unwanted information and artefacts:information, indicating that they will interact with a virtual iPhone and that they will learn about a hypothetical company via an investment news app. We tell participants that they will receive news articles, be asked to make an investment judgment, and be asked to justify that judgment. We incentivize participants to take the investment judgment seriously by telling them that they will be entered into a drawing for one of five $15 bonuses if their justification is judged to be in the top 20 percent of responses. We also tell participants that they will have access to a game app that they can use for entertainment when not reading about the company.The purpose of this game app is to simulate investors' actual interactions with mobile devices, in which smartphone users have multiple apps competing for their attention. Participants can pause and resume the game as needed. We incentivize participants to interact with the game by telling them that we will enter those who score in the top 20 percent into a drawing for one of five $15 bonuses.Next, participants complete training that walks them through the virtual iPhone, including the investment news and game apps. This training indicates to participants the number of articles that they will receive via the news app and tells participants that they will not be able to proceed with the study until they have accessed all of the articles. We enforce this rule by programming Qualtrics to hide the 'Next' button until a participant has opened all of the articles in the news app.To mimic real-life interaction with mobile devices, participants must only access an article to have it "count" as read. We do not require participants to read the article or to spend any specific amount of time with the article open. This design choice holds constant the information set across our information release conditions while allowing users to naturally choose the extent to which they wish to interact with this information.Before proceeding with the study, we require participants to demonstrate their understanding of the virtual iPhone and the apps by correctly answering questions about these features.
	Here is the text with unwanted information removed:The articles that appear in the investment news app are press releases issued by a hypothetical company in the consumer goods industry and delivered by a third-party news provider. We base all of the articles, which report positive news, on actual releases issued by companies in the consumer goods industry. The articles are split evenly; half of the articles provide nonfinancial information and half provide financial information. The nonfinancial information describes the company's sustainability efforts, its receipt of an employee choice award, and its recognition as an ethical company. The financial information discloses fourth-quarter results, updates the company's full-year guidance, and outlines the company's long-term growth strategy. Once participants have accessed all of the press releases in the news app, they proceed to the final section of the task.As our primary dependent variable, we endow participants with $10,000 to invest in the hypothetical company, and we tell participants that any money not invested in the company will be invested in competitor companies. Participants use a slider bar to indicate how much they would like to invest in the focus company, and the screen displays the amount invested in the company versus the amount invested in competitors. On a conceptual level, this dependent variable captures the strength of participants' desire to invest in the company. All else equal, willingness to invest will drive market demand for the company's stock, thereby affecting stock price. After recording the investment amount, participants advance to the next screen, on which we ask them to explain how they chose the amount to invest.
	Here is the text with the unwanted information removed:Independent VariablesWe manipulate push notifications (present versus absent) between-participants. Participants in the push notification present conditions receive banner notifications whenever a new article is available. Each banner notification includes an audio alert and appears at the top of the virtual iPhone screen. During the five seconds while the notification is visible, participants may click on the notification to be taken directly to the news app. In addition, they can click on the news app on the home screen to see the list of articles. Participants in the push notification absent conditions do not receive a notification when news is released and, accordingly, must click on the news app via the home screen to access the news releases. In all conditions, the icon for the news app on the home screen of the virtual iPhone has a red “badge” that shows the number of articles that are available but have yet to be accessed by the participant.We manipulate the form of information release (grouped versus ungrouped) between-participants by providing either two or six news releases about the hypothetical company. We hold total information constant by presenting the same disclosure as either two longer releases or six shorter releases. An example of grouped versus ungrouped information is available in Appendix 1. In all conditions, we hold constant the order in which the articles appear, with participants receiving the nonfinancial news releases first and the financial news releases after. Thus, in the grouped condition, participants receive one three-part nonfinancial article and then one three-part financial article. In the ungrouped condition, participants receive three nonfinancial articles and then three financial articles. Regardless of whether they are accompanied by push notifications or not, the news releases appear in the app at pre-specified times.
	Here is the text with unwanted information removed:Intervals (unbeknownst to the participants). In the ungrouped conditions, articles appear 45, 90, 150, 235, 295, and 340 seconds after a participant begins the task. We vary the time between news releases so that participants cannot detect a pattern, and are therefore unable to predict exactly when new information will arrive. In the grouped conditions, the news articles appear 150 and 340 seconds after a participant begins the task.Our third independent variable is the I-FoM O scale factor score for each participant. Participants complete this ten-item scale on a separate screen after responding to the dependent variable and providing their investment justification.Hypothesis TestsOur primary dependent variable is the amount of money that participants invest in the target company. We report descriptive statistics for this variable in Table 2, Panel A. Our first hypothesis predicts that receiving ungrouped versus grouped releases has a greater effect on investors' investment allocations in the presence, rather than absence, of push notifications. Our second hypothesis predicts that the overall effect of push notification and information release ungrouping on investment allocations is greater for higher I-FoMO individuals.Because our independent variables are both categorical (Information Release and Push Notification) and continuous (I-FoMO factor score), we rely on a fully-crossed analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) for our primary analysis, presented in Table 2, Panel B. As predicted in H1, the coefficient on the Information Release × Push Notification interaction term is significant (F1,170 = 3.32, p = 0.03, one-tailed). However, we note that the form of our interaction differs somewhat from what we predicted in H1. We return to this point in the additional analyses section.17 Our analysis uses standardized factor scores. If we examine the raw I-FoMO scores, we find that participants had a mean (median) score of 2.78 (2.85) on a five-point scale with scores ranging from 1.00 to 5.00. Consistent with the idea that I-FoMO is a stable trait, average I-FoMO scores do not differ by experimental condition (all p > 0.32).
	Here is the cleaned text:Below, further, this significant two-way interaction is qualified by a significant three-way interaction with I-FoMO (F1,170 = 2.18, p = 0.07, one-tailed). Consistent with H2, I-FoMO moderates the effects of push notifications and information ungrouping.To better understand the role of I-FoMO as a moderator of the combined effect of push notification and information release, we use participants’ standardized I-FoMO factor scores to discriminate between Low and High I-FoMO individuals. These scores are centered at zero and range from –1 to +1. Accordingly, we classify individuals with factor scores less than zero as “Low I-FoMO” and individuals with factor scores greater than zero as “High I-FoMO.” We present descriptive statistics by I-FoMO level in Table 3, Panel A. Finally, we conduct follow-up two-way between-participants ANOVAs and prepare interaction plots for the Low I-FoMO and High I-FoMO subgroups separately and report these results in Table 3, Panel B and Figure 1, respectively. For Low I-FoMO participants, the ANOVA shows no significant main effects or interaction (all p’s ≥ 0.40). However, the ANOVA for High I-FoMO participants shows a significant information release × push notification interaction (F1,86 = 8.92, p < 0.01).Given the significant information release × push notification interaction for the High I-FoMO individuals, we also examine the follow-up simple effects to better understand the form of this interaction. Consistent with our expectations, the effect of information ungrouping is significant when push notifications are present ($8,920.22 vs. $7,049.77, F1,86 = 6.93, p < 0.01)
	Here is the text with the unwanted information removed:one-tailed), but not when push notifications are absent ($6,972.20 vs. $8,105.28, F 1,86 = 2.17, p = 0.12, two-tailed). For completeness, we also examine the two remaining simple effects and find that push notifications have a significant effect when information is ungrouped ($8,920.22 vs. $6,972.20, F 1,86 = 7.32, p < 0.01, two-tailed), but not when it is grouped ($7,049.77 vs. $8,105.28, F 1,86 = 2.07, p = 0.13, two-tailed). These results support our prediction that individuals with higher I-FoMO are more sensitive to the effects of push notification and information release ungrouping.As shown in Figure 1, for High I-FoMO participants, ungrouping information appears to reduce investment allocations in the absence of push notifications. Although this result does not reach conventional levels of significance (p = 0.12), it is directionally surprising because we would expect this line to be flat rather than downward sloping. Accordingly, we examine unobtrusively-collected process data to provide greater insight into the behaviors of higher I-FoMO individuals that could suggest an explanation for our pattern of results.First, we examine the extent to which High I-FoMO individuals access the news app relative to Low I-FoMO individuals. Specifically, we examine Total Opens, which captures the total number of times individuals open the news app by clicking on either a banner notification or the icon directly. To control for the differential number of information releases, we collapse across the grouped and ungrouped conditions. An (untabulated) two-way ANOVA that fully crosses I-FoMO (High versus Low) with Push Notification (present versus absent) reveals a significantly
	Here is the text with unwanted information removed:greater mean number of Total Opens for High than for Low I-FoMO individuals (5.07 vs. 4.57; F1,174 = 2.67 , p = 0.10, two-tailed).Second, we examine the extent to which Hi gh I-FoMO individuals “over-check” the news app relative to Low I-FoMO individuals. To calcul ate over-checking, we s ubtract the number of times the individual clicks on the news app from the number of times an individual clicks on the home button. This variable captures the number of times that an individual views the home screen to see if there are unread news items (as shown by the notification badge on the news app), but then does not click on the news app as it does not show any unread items. An (untabulated) two-way ANOVA that fully crosses I-FoMO (High versus Low) with Push Notification (present versus absent) reveals significantly more over-checking for High than for Low I-FoMO individuals (3.46 vs. 2.93; F 1,171 = 3.56 , p = 0.06, two-tailed).Overall, these analyses indicate that High I-FoMO individuals fear missing out on investment information and, as a result, more actively seek out this information. Thus, the downward slope that we observe in the absence of push notifications could result from the High I-FoMO individuals knowing that they are going to receive six pieces of information, being concerned that they will not be alerted to this information as it arrives, checking for it more often than is necessary, and becoming frustrated as a result. Although admittedly post hoc, if this frustration colors their view of the firm, then it can result in the lower investment allocation that we observed in the push notification absent/un-grouped information release condition.We did not find evidence to support an I-FoMO × push notification interaction (F 1,174 = 1.08 , p = 0.30, two-tailed). This analysis omits three individuals who remained in the news app for the duration of the task, which precludes us from calculating their level of over-checking, as they are, in effect, checking continuously by having the news app open. This main effect is qualified by a significant I-FoMO × push notification interaction. (F1,171 = 3.10 , p = 0.08, two-tailed). The form of this interaction indicates that when push notifications are present, High and Low I-FoMO individuals engage in a similar amount of over-checking. However, when push notifications are absent, High I-FoMO individuals engage in more over-checking than Low I-FoMO individuals, which is consistent with the behavior that we would expect from High versus Low I-FoMO individuals.
	Here is the text with all unwanted information removed:To help corroborate our post hoc explanation, we look to additional measures that we collected during the experiment. If High I-FoMO individuals experience frustration in the absence of push notifications, we would expect this frustration to increase as the opportunity to receive more information increases. We assert that this frustration occurs because, absent notifications, High I-FoMO individuals may feel as if they are not receiving this information in a timely fashion. Consistent with this, we find that High I-FoMO individuals who do not receive push notifications perceive information to be less timely when they receive six releases (72.85) than when they receive two releases (84.04) and this difference is significant (t= -1.72, p = 0.08, two-tailed).In addition to providing evidence consistent with our post hoc explanation and underlying theory, this analysis enriches our understanding of High I-FoMO individuals and also suggests additional opportunities for research that examines their behavior.Ruling out Alternative ExplanationsGiven that I-FoMO is a measured independent variable, there is a concern that it proxies for a correlated construct that would explain our observed pattern of results. For example, the results for High I-FoMO individuals could be due to a different level of intelligence or ability relative to Low I-FoMO individuals. To address this concern, we look to post-experimental demographic questions that can serve as proxies (albeit imperfect) for intelligence/ability. We find that Low and High I-FoMO individuals do not differ in their education level or their propensity to have read financial statements (all p > 0.39). They also do not differ in their experiences with smartphones, news apps, or financial apps (all p > 0.38). Thus, we do not find any evidence to suggest that our results for H2 are driven by intelligence/ability differences.
	Here is the cleaned-up text, removing unwanted information and artefacts:We do find, however, that High I-FoMO individuals are more likely to have purchased stocks via direct investment (p = 0.04). They also have taken significantly more accounting classes (2.87 vs. 2.17, p = 0.05), have less work experience (11.7 vs. 16.4 years, p < 0.01), and are younger (32.7 vs. 38.8 years, p < 0.01).21 These results suggest that higher I-FoMO individuals are more interested in investment settings than are lower I-FoMO individuals, consistent with the idea that higher I-FoMO individuals are more fearful of missing out on investment information. Another possibility is that higher I-FoMO individuals are more easily distracted than are lower I-FoMO individuals, thereby explaining our pattern of results for H2.To examine this possibility, we conduct a brief follow-up survey using a separate sample of 300 individuals from Amazon Mechanical Turk. Participants complete the ten-item I-FoMO scale, a 15-item distractibility sub-scale from the Short Imaginal Processes Inventory (SIPI) (Huba, Singer, Aneshensel, and Antrobus 1982), and answer demographic questions. We find that I-FoMO is not significantly correlated with distractibility (r = 0.06, p = 0.35), suggesting that our main results are not driven by differences in the ease with which lower and higher I-FoMO individuals may become distracted.Overall, we conclude that higher I-FoMO individuals are likely more concerned with missing out on investment information due to their inherent interest in investment settings, but do not exhibit differences in intelligence/ability or distraction in ways that could explain our observed results.2321 Although these demographic variables differ between Low and High I-FoMO individuals, we conduct four separate ANCOVAs to confirm that they do not substitute for I-FoMO in the three-way interaction with information release and push notification to predict individuals’ investment judgments (all p's > 0.35).22 We retained 273 responses, excluding participants that have duplicate IP addresses and fail the test for native English speaker. Our conclusions are not sensitive to any exclusion criteria (p > 0.31 regardless of decision rule).23 In a separate Amazon Mechanical Turk survey, we find that I-FoMO is not significantly correlated with risk aversion (r = -0.04, p = 0.53), but is significantly correlated with three of the Big-Five personality dimensions – agreeableness (r = -0.12, p = 0.04), conscientiousness (r = 0.10, p = 0.09), and openness to experience (r = -0.13, p = 0.04). The correlations with the Big-Five are markedly different than those observed for traditional FoMO, which is significantly negatively correlated with emotional stability and conscientiousness (Stead and Bibby 2017). This suggests that individuals higher in I-FoMO have different personality characteristics, and likely different behaviors, than do individuals higher in traditional FoMO. While we believe that this is a reasonable inference, we have not yet tested this hypothesis.
	Here is the extracted text without unwanted information and artefacts:VII. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONSAdvances in information technology have changed the way that the media disseminates information to users. Investors increasingly rely on mobile devices to obtain information and, in response to increased mobile usage, news agencies have begun to ungroup information into shorter releases. The number of these releases, and the push notifications that often accompany them, have increased as news agencies vie for users’ attention. Both the ungrouping of news, as well as push notification technology, have the potential to exacerbate some users’ fears that they may be missing out on investment information, and both have the potential to affect how individuals interpret information. However, to date, we have little understanding of how these trends affect investment judgments. Our research investigates these issues. We develop and validate a scale for measuring investment-related FoMO (I-FoMO), a relevant personality trait, to examine how it affects the relationships between information release ungrouping, push notifications, and investor judgments.We find that information ungrouping interacts with the presence of push notifications such that ungrouped information results in more favorable investment judgments in the presence of push notifications. Further, we find that investors in our study differ in their degree of I-FoMO, and this difference interacts with our manipulated variables. Namely, those higher in I-FoMO are more sensitive to the interactive effects of push notifications and information ungrouping than are investors lower in I-FoMO. Finally, our process data sheds light on the differences in behavior between lower and higher I-FoMO individuals, and our post-experimental questions and additional survey data allow us to rule out alternative explanations for our results.Note that it is not something that we tested directly, thereby creating an opportunity for future research.
	Here is the text with all unwanted information removed:Our research contributes to the literature in accounting that examines how technology and media affect investors’ reactions to information. Smartphones and their features (e.g., news, investment, and social media apps) increase both the media’s and investors’ ability to disseminate information, which improves investors’ ability to act on this information. We examine how receiving information via mobile apps, which often involves push notifications and ungrouping of news, affects investors and interacts with their personality to influence investment judgments.Given the increased use of smartphones to access information, and the change in how the news media disseminates this information, there are opportunities for additional research in this area. We also make a methodological contribution to the literature. We extend prior literature that has examined individuals’ fear of missing out (FoMO). Whereas that literature addresses the fear of missing out on rewarding social experiences, we develop a scale that captures individuals’ fear of missing out on information that can be used to generate economic returns (I-FoMO). Traditional FoMO has been anecdotally applied to investment settings in the past, but we demonstrate that our I-FoMO scale captures a separate construct that is more specific to investment settings.Although we investigate how I-FoMO affects individuals’ evaluations of target investment firms, we believe I-FoMO may also play an important role in decisions within firms. Future research can explore this possibility. From a practical perspective, our results have implications for investors in that they highlight how common mobile technology features can affect investment behavior. Even when total information content is held constant, ungrouped information can interact with push notification, leading to changes in investors’ judgments and decisions.
	Here is the text with all unwanted information removed:which can lead to increased reliance on the information and thereby affect investors’ overall views of the firm. These results highlight a consequence of increased mobile device use for investment tasks. If investors suspect that push notifications could result in behavior that is not congruent with their investment goals, then one solution would be to disable push notifications that relate to investment news. Ironically, higher I-FoMO individuals may have a difficult time determining whether push notifications are helpful or harmful to their investment goals, thereby making them less likely to disable these notifications, even if it would be beneficial to do so.Our study provides several opportunities for future research. First, we chose to hold constant the valence associated with the news releases. We view this choice as consistent with most real-world scenarios in which the media primarily receives positive news from firms. However, future research could examine how mobile technology affects investors’ evaluations of negative or mixed-valence information. Presumably, investors’ evaluations of negative information would be analogous to those of positive information, whereas investors’ evaluations of mixed-valence information would likely be more nuanced. Second, we chose to randomly assign investors to receive (or not receive) push notifications to understand the effects while controlling for self-selection. However, future research could investigate the circumstances under which investors choose to opt-in versus opt-out of receiving investment-related push notifications. Third, we examine the effects of mobile technology on only one subset of market participants. We view nonprofessional investors as an important subset, as over 54.5 million U.S. households own equities and roughly 70 percent of these households have made investment decisions without the help of an investment advisor. Further, popular investment apps and online platforms have made it increasingly easy for individuals to engage in self-directed investing, which may exacerbate the potential issue of I-FoMO.
	Here is the cleaned-up text, removing unwanted information such as line numbers, authors list, editor information, and references list:brokerage firms provide mobile investment apps as a way to attract and retain retail clients, again indicating the importance of studying this subset. That said, future research could examine the effect of mobile technology and the role of I-FoMO in other areas of the capital markets.Fourth, the focus of our study was to establish our predicted effects at the individual level before considering how market forces either exacerbate or attenuate these effects. Accordingly, we did not conduct a laboratory market. Thus, we cannot determine whether investors in our setting would experience favorable or unfavorable market outcomes as a result of their choices.On the one hand, if individuals with higher I-FoMO are more affected by the interactive effects of push notifications and information ungrouping, then these individuals may be able to act more quickly in response to new information and reap financial rewards as a result. On the other hand, acting more quickly may not be beneficial if investors do not spend sufficient time evaluating information quality or if investors are more likely to overtrade in response to this information.Future research could examine these competing possibilities, and the results of such work would be of interest to regulators (such as the SEC) tasked with protecting individual investors.

	Here is the extracted text without unwanted information and artefacts:Fear of Missing out on Financial Gains:Associations Between Fear of Missing Out,Problem Gambling, and Speculative Trading inCollege StudentsAbstractIn recent years a fear of missing out (FOMO) on short-term monetary gains through speculative trading has been highlighted as a driving force of financial behaviors. Additionally, increasing evidence has likened speculative trading to gambling. The current study sought to determine whether financial FOMO is linked to stock market and cryptocurrency trading activities and problem gambling severity in both traditional gambling and financial trading domains, among a sample of 258 college students. Results of binomial regression and hurdle model analyses found that financial FOMO was linked to participation in stock market and cryptocurrency trading. Financial FOMO was also associated with problem gambling severity in traditional gambling and the presence of gambling problems in the stock market trading domain. Our results suggest that financial FOMO may be a salient risk factor of problem gambling in traditional gambling domains and, to a smaller degree, in the speculative trading domain among young adults.Keywords: fear of missing out, cryptocurrency, speculative trading, problem gambling, bitcoinIntroductionYoung adulthood is a tumultuous developmental period characterized by transitioning into adult roles and establishing independence. Among the key milestones young adults strive for is financial independence, but for college students, financial independence may be delayed, relative to peers who immediately join the workforce, and prolonged financial dependence on one's parents can have adverse psychological effects on young adults' wellbeing. Thus, college students may face pressures to seek financial gains in non-traditional ways, given many do not have time for full-time employment while enrolled in coursework. In recent years, there has been a major spike in the prevalence of young adults who engage in online speculative trading of financial assets, which may be seen as a low-risk way of getting ahead financially, especially for those who fear they are falling behind their peers in terms of financial independence. For instance, in 2023, 28 of U.S. adults ages 18 to 29 reported having traded cryptocurrencies, a popular financial asset for speculative trading, 14 of whom traded for the first time in the past year.Although these novel forms of speculative trading (e.g., short term trading of stock and cryptocurrency trading) may be viewed as low-stakes, there is increasing consensus that speculative trading indeed falls under the definition of gambling, which can entail, or lead to, highly addictive and potentially destructive behavior. Engaging in gambling behaviors at a young age is concerning given that young adulthood is a vulnerable period for the onset of addictive behaviors. It is therefore important to begin examining speculative trading behaviors from a gambling perspective and to identify risk factors for engagement in these behaviors. In doing so, the current study examines links between college students' fears of missing out on financial gains, engagement in online financial trading, and problematic gambling indicators.Note: The abstract and keywords were already present in the original text, so no changes were made to those sections.
	Here is the text of the original scientific article, with all unwanted information removed:In financial markets, speculative trading is the act of putting money into a financial position that has a substantial risk of losing value but also holds the expectation of a significant gain over a short term. Some examples of speculative trading include day-trading or high-frequency trading where stocks are bought and sold on the same day to make immediate profits, investing in penny stocks with almost no value but a minute chance of increasing their value to many multiples of the value at which it was bought, shorting, which involves borrowing stock and immediately selling in hopes the market value will decrease and be repurchased at a lower rate before returning to the investor, and investing in and selling cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, which are highly volatile with common swings of 40 in a single day.Speculative trading is appealing to young adults as they often believe this is a low-risk form of investment. However, while gambling and traditional investing are widely considered to be on the same spectrum, but at opposite ends, speculative trading activities increasingly function more as casino-like gaming than investing.Speculative trading fits within the standard definition of gambling, defined as placing something of value on an event that has a possibility of resulting in a larger more beneficial outcome, carries the risk of loss, and is predicated largely on chance. Similarities between speculative trading and gambling have been identified in a recently published review, including high likelihood of losses, shared links to personality traits including over-confidence, impulsiveness, and sensation seeking, help-seeking behavior among a minority of participants, and product design similarities between trading and gambling platforms.As with traditional gambling behaviors, there is emerging evidence that speculative trading can have detrimental interpersonal consequences including substantial financial losses and debt problems, mental and physical health issues such as depression and insomnia, and even a recent death by suicide in which the young man directly cited severe losses from speculative trading.Gambling is a widespread activity, with 85 of the U.S. adult population participating in gambling over their lifetime. Problem gambling refers specifically to persistent gambling behavior despite negative consequences. Key features of problem gambling include preoccupation with gambling, experiencing withdrawal symptoms when not gambling, and developing tolerance (needing to gamble with larger amounts of money), which have been observed in individuals who engage in frequent short-term trading activities.The prevalence of problem gambling is estimated at between 1 and 3 among adults and between 6 and 9 of adolescents and young adults in the United States, representing as many as 7 million individuals. Several studies have found that young adults have the highest lifetime and current (past year) prevalence of problem gambling among all adult age groups.Fear of missing out (FOMO) is a psychological construct that was popularized in the early 2000s to describe the fear or anxiety one may experience when they think they are missing out on a rewarding experience. Studies have demonstrated that FOMO is relevant across age groups and genders but its intensity is correlated with younger age.FOMO has been reported/examined in numerous domains, including purchasing consumer products, playing video games, and using social networking services, but most relevant to the current study, people may experience FOMO-related to reaping financial gains. FOMO on monetary gains through speculative trading activities has been speculated to be a driving force behind individuals' financial trading decisions, as stories of reaping quick, astronomical profits from financial trading have become commonplace on online news and social media websites, and greater exposure to these accounts of fast profits have been shown to fuel obsessive financial wagering activities among some individuals.
	Here is the text without unwanted information:Identifying correlates of problem gambling behaviors among college students bears public health significance related to early intervention and prevention. Understanding the links between financial FOMO and problem gambling as well as potentially related speculative trading behaviors can contribute to the development of effective problem gambling prevention and treatment approaches. Despite the potential for FOMO related to financial rewards to be linked to problem gambling and speculative trading, prior research has not assessed FOMO in the context of these financially-oriented activities. The current study was designed to begin exploring this research gap by assessing financial FOMO's relationship to trading activity participation and to problem gambling across traditional gambling and trading domains in young adults, a population known to have high rates of problem gambling.We hypothesized that financial FOMO would be positively associated with speculative trading behavior (i.e., stocks, cryptocurrency), and with problem gambling scores (i.e., both regarding traditional gambling and specific to speculative trading).Participants and ProceduresStudy participants were 328 undergraduate students enrolled in introductory psychology courses at a large public university in the Pacific Northwest (United States). Participants' mean age was 19.3 years (SD = 1.3) and 67.4 identified their sex assigned at birth as female. Participants completed a one-time survey between September 2021 and March 2022 and entered the study on a voluntary basis, with credit for their course provided for study completion.MeasuresFinancial FOMO Scale (F-FOMO). A measure of financial FOMO was adapted from the 10-item Fear of Missing Out Scale (i.e., FoMOS; Przybylski et al., 2013) that was initially developed as a measure of fear of missing out on rewarding social experiences. We adapted the FoMOS by modifying four of the measure's items into financial contexts. The resulting Financial FOMO Scale (F-FOMO) includes the following items: “I fear that other people are making more profitable investments than I am”, “I fear that my friends are making more profitable investments than I am”, “I get worried when I find out my friends are making more profitable investments than I am”, and “It bothers me when I miss a good investing opportunity.” Response options ranged from 1 (Not at all true of me) to 5 (Extremely true of me).Engagement in Gambling and Trading Behaviors.Participants were asked about their engagement in different gambling activities with the question: “What types of gambling have you ever tried?” Possible choices were lottery tickets, casino table games, slot machines, card games with money bets, sport betting, Internet gambling, and other gambling. Participants who endorsed one or more response items were counted as having participated in gambling in their lifetime. Participants were also asked about their engagement in stock market and cryptocurrency trading activities with the following questions: “Have you ever bought cryptocurrencies (bitcoin, ethereum, etc.)?” and “Have you ever done stock market trading?” with a yes or a no as response options.Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI). The PGSI (Holtgraves et al., 2009) is a validated 9-item measure of problem gambling severity that symptoms like chasing losses, tolerance, and gambling consequences including social, financial, and health effects. The PGSI was developed for use with a general population to capture the severity of problem gambling across traditional gambling domains (e.g., casino games, slot machines, lottery, sports betting). Sum scores of 3 or higher indicate at-risk gambling behavior, and scores of 8 or higher are categorized as problem gambling behavior (Holtgraves et al., 2009).

Here is the exact text of the original scientific article:Materials) was adapted to refer to stock trading (PGSI-ST) and cryptocurrency trading (PGSI-CT), separately, but each sub-scale was only shown to participants who endorsed engaging in the given trading context during lifetime. Internal reliability was acceptable for both versions of the adapted PGSI (α for the PGSI-ST = 0.81; α for the PGSI-CT = 0.91).The Abbreviated Impulsivity Scale (ABIS) is a 13-item measure of impulsivity as a personality trait. ABIS was assessed to capture impulsivity as a covariate of trading participation and problem gambling based on support from past literature. Internal reliability for ABIS was relatively low but nevertheless acceptable in our sample (α = 0.64).AnalysesTo estimate associations between financial FOMO and engagement in any stock market and cryptocurrency trading, we used logistic regression analyses. Separate models were fit for stock market trading and cryptocurrency trading, using the “glm” function in R (version 3.6.3). Trading activity participation (binary variable) was the dependent variable, and the composite Financial FOMO Scale score was used as the independent variable. ABIS score as a measure of impulsivity, sex assigned at birth, and self-reported relative household wealth were included as covariates in the analyses.The second series of models entailed examining associations between financial FOMO and indices of problem gambling pertaining to traditional gambling, stock trading, and cryptocurrency trading. Given scores on these three problem gambling scales were all positively skewed with overdispersion due to zero-inflation, we employed a zero-truncated hurdle modeling approach that simultaneously models the outcome in two parts: (a) a logistic model estimating the odds/likelihood of any (vs. zero) problem gambling symptoms and (b) a truncated count model estimating the amount of problem gambling symptoms among the subset of participants scoring >0.ResultsDescriptive StatisticsOf the 328 participants who enrolled in the study, 285 finished the complete set of measures that pertain to the present study. Data from the 43 participants who did not complete the measures relevant to the present study were excluded from data analysis.Prevalence of lifetime, at-risk and problem gambling/trading activities by sex are presented in Table 1. Prevalence of lifetime gambling was similar between the two sexes, with more pronounced differences found in at-risk and problem gambling rates and in trading activity participation rates.AnalysesFinancial FOMO and Trading Activity ParticipationResults of the logistic regression models estimating associations between financial FOMO and any engagement in stock trading and/or cryptocurrency trading are shown in Table 2. Regarding stock trading, each one-unit increase in financial FOMO scores was associated with an 8.5 increased odds of engaging in lifetime stock trading behaviors. Financial FOMO scores were also associated with greater odds/likelihood of cryptocurrency trading activity participation, again by 8.5 for each incremental point in Financial FOMO score.Financial FOMO and Problem Gambling SeverityIn the zero-truncated hurdle model testing the hypothesis that financial FOMO is associated with problem gambling severity in traditional gambling domain (Table 3), the logistic portion of the model estimated associations with any PGSI score greater than 0 (i.e., scores of 0 vs. any score >0), and the zero-truncated portion of the model estimated associations with PGSI scores, as a count outcome, among the participants who scored >0.
	Here is the cleaned text of the scientific article:FOMO scores). Among those who scored >0, the countportion shows that financial FOMO was associated withhigher PGSI scores (i.e., a 4.8 increase in PGSI scores for each one-unit increase in Financial FOMO scores).The model shown in Table 4 estimated associations between financial FOMO and problematic speculative trading behaviors (i.e., PGSI-ST scores). In the logistic portion, there was a positive effect of Financial FOMO scores on any stock trading problems (i.e., PGSI-ST scores >0), such that each one-unit increase in Financial FOMO scores was associated with 20.1 increased odds of scoring >0 on the PGSI-ST. However, the zero-truncated count portion of the model, estimating associations with severity scores among those >0 on the PGSI-ST, did not show a significant association. Thus, this hypothesis was only partially supported as financial FOMO was significantly associated with any problematic stock trading (relative to zero stock trading problems), but higher Financial FOMO scores were not associated with higher PGSI-ST scores, on average.The final model estimated associations between financial FOMO and problematic cryptocurrency trading (Table 5). Counter to hypotheses, financial FOMO was not significantly associated with problematic cryptocurrency trading in either the logistic or zero-truncated portions of the model.DiscussionIn this study, we sought to measure financial FOMO and investigate its association with speculative trading activities and problem gambling severity in a sample of 285 college students.Table 1.

	Here is the cleaned-up text of the scientific article:We adapted the FoMOS (Przybylski et al., 2013), a validated measure of social FOMO, to construct the Financial FOMO, a novel, brief measure of financial FOMO. The development of Financial FOMO builds on research efforts to better understand FOMO as a driver of financial behaviors (Baur et al., 2018; Delfabbro et al., 2021; Newall et al., 2022; Oksanen et al., 2022; Stettner, 2020) and provides direction for researchers seeking to measure FOMO across financially oriented contexts.In the first aim, we identified that financial FOMO was related to participation in trading activities that are increasingly considered as modern forms of gambling. Specifically, financial FOMO scores were positively associated with lifetime engagement in stock market trading and cryptocurrency trading, supporting our first hypothesis. These results build upon recent findings showing behavioral similarities between trading and gambling (Delfabbro et al., 2021; Newall et al., 2022; Oksanen et al., 2022), by identifying a potential common risk-factor in financial FOMO. That is, although prevalence of lifetime stock market and cryptocurrency trading were relatively low in this sample (29 and 14, respectively), those who report more anxiety about missing out on financial gains are more likely to be, or have been previously, engaged in speculative trading behaviors. The present findings also provide an important initial examination of financial FOMO in a relatively high-risk age group (mean age of 19.3), most of whom were in their first year of college enrollment, whereas past research on the topic focused on older adults from a broader age group.The second major aim of this study tested whether financial FOMO is linked to problem gambling, in both traditional gambling and speculative trading domains. Our results showed that higher financial FOMO scores were indeed related to reporting non-zero PGSI scores. Moreover, higher financial FOMO scores were associated with higher PGSI scores when we isolated participants with non-zero PGSI scores. Our findings imply that financial FOMO could be a risk factor for problem gambling in the traditional domain and, moreover, it may be a meaningful correlate of the severity of problem gambling among individuals who exhibit signs of problem gambling. These findings provide support for further investigating financial FOMO's role in problem gambling severity and suggest potential utility of financial FOMO in advancing problem gambling prevention and intervention efforts focused on financial literacy and management (Pham et al., 2012).Tables 4 and 5 present the results of the zero-truncated hurdle model estimating associations between financial FOMO and stock trading problem gambling severity scores (PGSI-ST) and cryptocurrency trading problem gambling severity scores (PGSI-CT), respectively.Note: The tables have been reformatted to remove unwanted information, such as line numbers, authors' lists, and references. The original meaning and phrasing of the text have been preserved.
	Here is the cleaned text of the scientific article:Financial FOMO was also linked to reporting non-zero PGSI-ST scores, similarly indicating a potential risk factor for problem gambling issues pertaining specifically to stock trading. However, there was no significant association between financial FOMO and variance in severity among those with positive PGSI-ST scores. This mixed evidence may require additional examination of the novel PGSI-ST scale to determine whether the non-zero scores were primarily driven by a small number of specific items. Participants could meet the non-zero ‘hurdle’ in these models even if they only endorsed one problematic stock trading behavior. Thus, while financial FOMO was not associated with more severe scores, it may be closely related to some of the specific PGSI-ST items.Our findings add to the emerging evidence from stock market participant surveys, Google search data, stock market trading, and margin use data documenting the relationship between FOMO and stock market participation. In particular, FOMO has been found to strongly motivate stock market participation among young adults, causing concern given their known vulnerability to problem gambling. Adding to the concern, margin use (borrowing money to trade) has been identified as an associated behavior of FOMO-driven stock trading, highlighting its detrimental risks of financial problems. Our results, combined with the aforementioned research findings on FOMO in stock markets, can serve as valuable data for motivating prevention and intervention efforts toward reducing the harm of financial FOMO-driven stock trading activities.In the final model, we found no evidence of an association between financial FOMO and problematic cryptocurrency trading assessed with PGSI-CT scores. Despite financial FOMO being frequently discussed in connection to cryptocurrency trading, the present results imply that financial FOMO may not have a salient link to problem gambling in cryptocurrency trading contexts. This conclusion is nevertheless drawn with caution, as the present study reflects early-stage research on relatively nascent speculative trading behaviors that are anticipated to continue to gain popularity among young adults. Given the lifetime prevalence of cryptocurrency trading behaviors of 14 in our sample, further investigation in other samples of young adults with higher prevalence of cryptocurrency trading may be warranted.We believe several factors may have contributed to smaller effects of financial FOMO on trading domains, relative to traditional gambling. Primarily, the sample sizes of participants who reported positive (non-zero) PGSI-ST (n= 37) and PGSI-CT (n= 11) scores were substantially smaller than the number of participants who reported positive PGSI (n= 77) scores. Thus, with low base rates of the outcome variables, and few participants informing variability among non-zero scores, detecting significant effects is somewhat challenging. Future studies on this topic should target recruitment to higher-risk groups and consider adding eligibility criteria to increase the base rate and improve analytic power to detect significant effects.It is also possible that in the context of financial trading, which is perceived to be more skill-based and disciplined than traditional forms of gambling, financial FOMO is less likely to be tied to problem gambling behaviors and consequences than it is in traditional gambling contexts such as casino games and slot machines, which are perceived to be more based upon luck. As non-traditional forms of gambling continue to increase in popularity, it will be prudent for researchers to continue to refine our understanding and operationalization of these behaviors within the larger context of gambling-related literature.Limitations of the study include the use of convenience sampling in introductory psychology classes at a single university, limiting the generalizability of the findings. Sampling young adults with higher engagement in speculative trading activities could yield more compelling effect sizes, relative to a general sample of young adult college students in which speculative trading prevalence is low. The study's small sample size (n= 285), especially with respect to subsamples who had positive PGSI-CT scores (n= 11), was another limitation of the study. The sample was also unbalanced with respect to gender (i.e., 67.4 female) and, although we adjusted each model by controlling for sex assigned at birth, a more balanced sample would improve precision and may increase generalizability. In addition, the Financial FOMO measure was based on four items adapted from a single source. A more extensive measure development and testing process could have yielded a more comprehensive measure of financial FOMO with a stronger rationale. Lifetime measures of trading and gambling involvement may have captured one-time activities that are not indicative of routine participation in either activity, but these early-stage findings nevertheless support the need for further longitudinal studies.
	Here is the text with all unwanted information removed:ConclusionsOur findings showed that financial FOMO was associated with the presence and severity of gambling problems in the traditional gambling domain, and that the magnitude of these effects was relatively large considering the non-clinical sample of young adults. Indeed, each one-unit increase in the Financial FOMO scale, which ranged from 4 to 20, was associated with a 4.8 increase in PGSI scores. Financial FOMO was also predictive of participation in stock and cryptocurrency trading – a novel and fast-growing phenomenon among young adults – and the presence of gambling problems in the stock market trading context, but not the severity of the problems. Taken together, our results contribute to our understanding of financial FOMO as a potential risk factor of problem gambling in traditional gambling domains and, to a smaller degree, in the speculative trading domain among young adults, and suggest its role in advancing our understanding of the motivations that drive problem gambling behaviors. Furthermore, our results imply financial FOMO could serve as a meaningful construct in the assessment and intervention of problem gambling in young adults, the public health and economic cost consequences of which are significant. Continued development and validation of financial FOMO measures and exploration of the role of financial FOMO in problem gambling behaviors across wider population groups will be necessary to continue advancing our understanding of the financial FOMO-problem gambling connection.Financial Fear of Missing Out Scale (F-FOMO)1.

In order to explain bandwagon consumption behavior, previous studies focused on brand, personal traits, and group characteristics. However, previous studies seem somewhat limited in explaining excessive bandwagon consumption. This study addresses a psychological trait, the Fear of Missing out (FoMO), which describes why people want to belong to a main group. Along with FoMO, product characteristics influence bandwagon consumption behavior because consumers may show different behaviors for different product categories. Hence, this study combines FoMO levels (high/low) and product category (luxury/necessity) to explain bandwagon consumption behavior. The results reveal that the combination of high FoMO and luxury shows the strongest bandwagon consumption behavior. The next strongest combination is low FoMO and necessity, followed by high FoMO and necessity, and low FoMO and luxury. Based on these findings, this study might present implications for understanding excessive bandwagon consumption based on psychological traits and product characteristics, which makes it possible for marketers to provide customizing products and services as well as advertising messages for young consumers groups who experience high levels of FoMO when establishing their marketing strategies.Keywords: bandwagon consumption; fear of missing out; luxury; necessity; consumption behavior1. IntroductionOver the last few years, there has been an unusual phenomenon of collectivism relating to consumption in which consumer behavior conforms towards the pursuit of specific brands [1]. For instance, Korean women in their 20s and 30s are commonly seen holding a Starbucks cup and enjoying the ambience of a Starbucks coffee shop [2]. Similarly, the Discovery expedition or the North Face jacket, which become known as the ‘teenagers’ secondary school uniform’, are must-have items for middle and high school students in South Korea [3,4]. The strong desire and preference for a particular brand accelerates this consumption pattern behavior [5]. This excessive consumption behavior frequently appears in eastern countries such as Korea and China [1]. Previous studies explain this mass consumption of particular brands as conformity consumption or following-up consumption [6,7]. This bandwagon consumption pattern deeply illustrates the phenomenon of collective consumption behavior which emulates the actions of others, and represents one’s social status, the belonging of a particular group, and conspicuous consumption.Bandwagon consumption refers the people’s desire to purchase a commodity so they can get into ‘the swim of things’ or to consumers following someone they are connected with [8]. The basis of bandwagon consumption behavior is that consumers purchase products and brands not only from a utilitarian perspective but also for non-utilitarian reasons such as symbolism and increased status, while the concept is derived from conspicuous consumption [9]. Previous studies have focused on the brand, personal traits, and group characteristics as determinants of bandwagon consumption behavior [10,11]. However, these studies seem somewhat limited in explaining excessive bandwagon consumption.In this study, we address a psychological trait, the Fear of Missing out (FoMO), which describes why people want to belong to a main group. Along with FoMO, product characteristics influence bandwagon consumption behavior because consumers may show different behaviors for different product categories. Hence, this study combines FoMO levels (high/low) and product category (luxury/necessity) to explain bandwagon consumption behavior.The results reveal that the combination of high FoMO and luxury shows the strongest bandwagon consumption behavior. The next strongest combination is low FoMO and necessity, followed by high FoMO and necessity, and low FoMO and luxury. Based on these findings, this study might present implications for understanding excessive bandwagon consumption based on psychological traits and product characteristics, which makes it possible for marketers to provide customizing products and services as well as advertising messages for young consumers groups who experience high levels of FoMO when establishing their marketing strategies.
	Here is the cleaned-up text without unwanted information:Conceptualization and theorization of bandwagon consumption. The study of Lascu and Zinkhan reveal the multiple influential factors affecting bandwagon consumption, especially the relevant tasks and situations, brand, group, and personal characteristics. The majority of recent studies on bandwagon consumption concentrate on psychological perception elements; especially, such as status signaling and association with affluent lifestyles in order to investigate what antecedents drive bandwagon consumption. By examining bandwagon consumption, previous studies have identified human basic psychological traits such as social superiority and belonging to a main group.In this context, an important question is why do consumers, in Korea, and China, conform to this excessive bandwagon consumption and become obsessed with particular brands, especially luxury brands? Is this collective consumption an intrinsic Eastern psychological assimilation of collectivism that provides stability through the pursuit of products? The typical type of bandwagon consumption which concerns higher quality, premium products, represents uniqueness and also provides a special meaning that defines status to others. Consumers, especially from the younger generations, can conform to cost-efficient products, and as practical consumers, seek to purchase useful, economical goods that have utility and reliability. Personal or group psychological traits such as susceptibility to a reference group, and influences from celebrities, can all influence bandwagon consumption. These traits translate into a form of social superiority and feeling a sense of belonging to a main group. Also, specific special cultures and cultural forces may affect bandwagon consumption. For instance, people all around the world, especially the younger generation, are fanatical towards BTS music, messages, and dance performances. Many East Asians enjoy watching Korean TV dramas and movies. Similarly to Hippie or Otaku culture, this Korean wave has drawn consumers' attention and hence many students from other countries increasingly prefer to study in Korea, and purchasing Korean pop music and other related products.Despite the contribution of extant studies covering various research areas and antecedent factors, these seem somewhat limited in fully explaining excessive bandwagon consumption (e.g., the deviation of consumption behavior of a particular group). It is often considered that those who are in their late teens, 20s, and early 30s pursue a relatively rational consumption pattern as reasonable consumers. But this rational consumption behavior does not entirely occur, as irrationality appears to be a part of pursuing expensive luxury goods, regardless of their price or other factors. In particular, a recent report shows that Asian international students in Korea, who regard themselves as being reasonable consumers, are particularly interested in luxury goods. It may be difficult to understand this phenomenon easily, because these consumers could prefer relatively cheaper products with respect to necessity items, so this study focuses on addressing the psychological basis for the phenomenon. This aim differs from most existing research, which tends to explain the aspect of belonging to the main group, and the anxiety to deviate from the mainstream. The phenomenon is also totally distinct from East Asia's collectivism or certain cultural factors such as Hippie, Korean wave, and Otaku trends.In order to fill this unexplored gap, this research addresses psychological traits and the Fear of Missing Out ("FoMO") principle, as methods to describe the concepts of following perceived abnormal consumption behavior, belonging to a mainstream group, and assimilating into local groups. Apart from psychological traits, a consumer's inclination toward bandwagon consumption can vary according to the particular objects of bandwagon consumption. For instance, the tendency towards bandwagon consumption may vary across product characteristics, as consumers may show different reactions between different product categories, such as luxury and necessity products, for example.The purpose of this paper is to propose an explanation for bandwagon consumption based on psychological traits and product characteristics. Moreover, this paper is concerned about this phenomenon from a Korean consumer perspective of those representing the millennial generation, as opposed to any other study group internationally or otherwise. In order to examine excessive bandwagon consumption, the concept of FoMO as a psychological trait possessed by a group, is accordingly assessed. Furthermore, product characteristics (luxury/necessity) are assessed as another salient element that contributes to the formation of consumer attitudes, behaviors, and
	Here is the cleaned-up text:Sustainability 2020, 12, 2441 3 of 16disposition. This is important as Asian international students in Korea, for example, may have different responses towards product characteristics depending on whether they are luxury products or necessities. Hence this research combines FoMO levels and product category differentiation to explain the bandwagon consumption behavior when exploring the combinations of psychological trait and product characteristics.2. Theoretical Background2.1. Bandwagon Consumption BehaviorAs a part of a community, individuals are prone to be affected by a group's thoughts, attitudes, and beliefs. For group members, this can, intentionally or otherwise, affect their product and brand choices, and hence reflect on the values upheld by that group. Being a member of a group is in itself a form of conformity, and group values and norms can thus have a substantial influence on a member's consumption behavior and decision-making when that member is very eager to be part of the mainstream. This phenomenon is referred to as the 'Bandwagon Effect'.Bandwagon consumption behavior exists when consumers buy a certain product to associate themselves within a specific group, and moreover obtain recognition from their own group. This action describes the increasing popularity of a product or phenomenon that encourages more people to 'get on the bandwagon' and indicates a person's aspiration towards procuring a brand in order to associate with a particular part of the mainstream. In other words, people are often inclined to imitate the consumption behavior of a respected (arguably higher) class. Leivenstein, who is a pioneer of the bandwagon effect, researched consumption behavior from the perspective of social motives and social needs, and theorized three kinds of effects on material consumption: the Veblen, Snob, and Bandwagon Effects. The Veblen Effect proposes that the consumer believes that price is a prestige indicator. The Snob Effect is similar, but describes the consumer as a seeker of unique value, which will therefore buy brands and products that others do not have. The Bandwagon Effect, however, describes the consumer as one that seeks a perceived social value, and thus values consumer behavior more highly than price.Previous studies on bandwagon consumption mainly focused on brand characteristics such as popularity, quality, and the differences between competing brands. Tsai et al. proposes that product popularity among celebrities, sports stars, and other role models of influence all enhances quality perception, and moreover results in bandwagon consumption. Due to product popularity, this bandwagon consumption behavior is (re)created when consumers observe the consumption behavior of others and purchase the same brands and products—"to be one of the boys". Another perspective of recent research on bandwagon consumption were related to personal characteristics; examples of relevant personal characteristics include personal traits, external stimuli, and group characteristics such as cultural forces. Recently, much research has been conducted on why consumers are so enthusiastic about purchasing luxury products. This type of consumption concerning luxury goods reflects prestige and higher-class status in addition to its function and utility. Balabanis and Kastanakis significantly contribute to the bandwagon consumption argument by providing insights from the consumers' perspective. Empirical evidence suggests that consumers who are dependent on others (by having an interdependent-self) show similarity to other consumers. Furthermore, Parilti and Tunc suggest that anxiety can also influence bandwagon consumption. Consumer anxiety theory states that personal consumption can sometimes cause anxiety in an individual, due to their perception that choices of consumption will be judged and influenced by others. According to the Consumer acculturation concept, individuals in individualistic cultures tend to have an independent view of the self that emphasizes uniqueness, whereas individuals in collectivistic cultures tend to have an interdependent view of the self that emphasizes conformity. Such a society, unlike an individualistic one, provides a consistent and overpowering need to belong to a group.
	Here is the text with the unwanted information removed:Although previous studies investigate the bandwagon consumption behavior on the basis of brand, personal, and group characteristics, little research has been conducted in the domain of a certain group or generation. Excessive bandwagon consumption of a certain group or generation, by definition, may be considered an abnormal consumption behavior, and previous studies have been limited in explaining such a phenomenon, especially in South Korea. Hence, this study explores psychological traits that are not so commonly covered, as a means to understand and explain excessive bandwagon consumption behavior.The Role of FoMO on Excessive Bandwagon Consumption BehaviorThe FoMO PhenomenonPrevious research on the psychological traits of bandwagon consumption has focused on why consumers purchase a specific product or brand. Moreover, research has led to psychological factors such as materialism, status-seeking predispositions, value consciousness, susceptibility of the reference group, and the need for uniqueness. However, these studies have some limitations in regards to explaining why consumers want to belong to a group, and moreover, why they show anxiety towards detachment from the mainstream group by abnormally purchasing a specific brand. In order to address this situation, this study adopts the conceptualization of FoMO as a psychological trait and examines bandwagon consumption behavior based on this FoMO phenomenon.FoMO is a psychological condition where individuals want to stay continuously associated with what others are doing and hence to be free from any anxiety caused when isolated from these wishes. Examples of FoMO behavior include browsing social networking sites and discovering oneself as not being associated with a friend's party or new topic, which can invoke fear and anxiety. In order to reduce this anxiety and psychological stress, people may thus become more diligent in following others. This may subsequently lead to a negative influence such as social networking site (SNS) overuse, phubbing, smartphone addiction, problematic socialization, and other adverse health consequences.FoMO and Excessive Bandwagon Consumption BehaviorThe FoMO studies from a psychological angle are heavily skewed towards certain elements, such as uneasiness or apprehension towards being detached from a main group, and furthermore, describe such behavior as being a source of addiction. In particular, much research regarding FoMO focuses on the media field, an area which stimulates an emotional state, can cause obsessive use of social media platforms such as SNSs or smartphone addiction. Hence, most research on FoMO is related to negative online impacts such as excessive SNS engagement and game addictions, especially among adolescents. FoMO can lead to adolescents spending much more time on online activities, thus leading to addiction. Recent research undertaken has supported earlier findings that FoMO reveals an anxiety caused fear of detachment from a group, and also that online social bonding and a strong sense of belonging to the mainstream are salient factors in FoMO. One of the major findings of research on this topic is the relationship between FoMO and both online and offline behavior.

Likewise, research on oï¬‚ine FoMO reveals an association with the need to belong and poor life satisfaction; both of these outcomes produce a negative impact.Interestingly, in the study, people with higher levels of FoMO tended to have increased interest in positive interactions and obtaining social approval. A common feature of online and oï¬‚ine FoMO found by research is that both lead people to aspire to gain a high level of perceived stability and belonging. In addition, the higher levels of FoMO people show, the greater their desire to belong to a group.Existing studies on FoMO assert that a social state of detachment commonly prevails, especially amongst younger generations, when they deviate from an idealized form of society. Consumers may instead imitate others so as to eliminate their fear of instability, anxiety, concern, and uneasiness. Therefore, the stronger the desire to enter a group, the greater the bandwagon consumption behavior persists for specific brands or products. When experiencing the risk of mainstream deviation, consumers increase their need for conformity from their surroundings. From this process, FoMO can stimulate consumers towards unreasonable consumption behavior in specific areas and exert pressure to purchase particular brands or products. That is, FoMO can stimulate unreasonable consumption behavior in specific areas and exert pressure to purchase particular brands or products.
	Here is the extracted text with unwanted information removed:represents a conceptualization of a psychological trait, in that people do not want to be excluded from the mainstream, and significantly, this psychological trait is usefully exploited via consumer behavioral research. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider FoMO as a psychological state that can tend towards unconditional conformity, and is therefore a salient factor in analyzing excessive bandwagon consumption behavior.From the discussion of this study on FoMO, researchers paid attention to the role of FoMO so as to examine people's consequential reactions to this emotion. Moreover, they revealed a link between the level of FoMO and behavior, and indicated that the level of FoMO has a direct relationship with the level of involvement in social media engagement, positive social interaction, and wanting social approval. In this way, FoMO can stimulate consumption behavior by increasing the observing of others and encouraging people to follow mainstream tendencies. The level of influence could largely depend on the degree of FoMO experienced. However, it is important to conclude that FoMO is not the only influential factor in this context.Product characteristics may also influence bandwagon consumption. Product characteristics can explain why a consumer chooses a product and what purpose it is used for. Products may be classified in terms of appearance, consumer valuation, and lifestyle image, for example. Moreover, products can be separated by their necessity or luxury status, based on their degree of functionality and symbolism. They may be public or private products, depending on the scope of expression available for these products. Also, they may be deemed to be hedonic or utilitarian, depending on whether they have a purpose for pleasure or practicality.Luxury goods as a symbolic product, place emphasis on product quality, status symbolism, and brand exclusiveness. On the other hand, necessity goods are considered as a functional product and their appeal comes from a price and utilitarian perspective. Lascu and Zinkhan assert that with luxury goods, visibility is positively associated with the bandwagon consumption, whilst necessity and convenience goods are negatively associated. Moreover, Bearden and Etzel propose a ‘necessity-luxury item dimension’. The necessity-luxury item dimension compares products based on their ownership; necessities are ‘possessed by everyone’, whereas luxuries are products that possess a degree of exclusivity.Considering Asian international students’ circumstances in Korea, they can be seen to possess two kinds of identity, insomuch as they are foreigners as well as students and play a role within an unfamiliar environment. Hence, the common opinion is that they are reasonable consumers with no significant income and they prefer well-functioning, practical, and price-sensitive goods, and, unlike Koreans in their late teens, 20s, and early 30s, they are likely to show a greater tendency toward focusing on necessity goods in order to lower their risk of high product usage.Bandwagon consumption is inextricably connected to product category (i.e., luxury-necessity) as well as FoMO (psychological trait), so it is relevant for this research to focus on analyzing the influences of bandwagon consumption behavior.As Asian international students have different backgrounds and cultures, they may feel that they are outsiders with a strong desire to ‘belong’, leading them to follow others and purchase host brands to aid assimilation, or alternatively connect to their native heritage. They are generally better educated and more open-minded, and as cosmopolites, are more susceptible to be influenced by...
	Here is the text with all unwanted information removed:foreign cultures [57]. This means that the role of FoMO is influential for Asian international students and FoMO can play a key role in bandwagon consumption.The collective behavior of consumers that belong to a main group may be represented by the concept of FoMO. However, it is obvious that Asian international students as consumers do not have the same level of FoMO, and that different levels of FoMO will drive them towards different behavioral outcomes [21,49]. Based on previous studies, people with higher levels of FoMO spend more time on online activities, such as social media engagements in response [38,51,58,59]. Those who have high levels of FoMO tend to drink more during large scale events, to feel a sense of belonging to a group, achieve psychological stability [49], to think of others as a part of himself/herself [60], and show positive social behaviors towards others [50]. It appears that people with higher levels of FoMO stimulate associations with the mainstream that they wish to join.Hence, it would be reasonable to divide FoMO into different levels when explaining bandwagon consumption behavior. Therefore, this study presents the following hypothesis:Hypothesis 1 (H1). Higher levels of FoMO lead to stronger bandwagon consumption behavior.As mentioned above, those with high FoMO levels show greater eagerness to belong to a group and demonstrate a greater need for social approval [50]. Consumers with high levels of FoMO prefer to purchase conspicuous goods to display a desirable status, show ostentation, and stay connected with their peers. Consumers purchase luxury goods not only because of their perceived high quality, but also to feed their social needs. Luxury goods are observed as images in the minds of consumers that link to high levels of price, quality, aesthetics, rarity, and extraordinariness. Moreover, they represent many non-functional associations, which reflect authority, personality, and high levels of relatedness [29,61,62].Conversely, it follows that for those with a low level of FoMO, Asian international students as consumers would show a smaller tendency towards bandwagon consumption than those with high levels of FoMO. This suggests that these students should act as reasonable consumers due to the limitations on their student income and an unwillingness to follow others blindly, and instead should focus on the price and value of goods.When purchasing luxury goods, people are often likely to be influenced by factors such as price, quality, uniqueness, and the group they aspire to belong to. As a result of high levels of FoMO, people tend to remain in the mainstream. As such, this can lead to consumer adherence to an associated, main group and lead to strong bandwagon consumption behaviors. On the other hand, financial considerations tend towards reduced conformity responses compared to luxury, since consumers do not prioritize status and mainstream belonging so highly under these circumstances [10]. This would lead people to be reasonable consumers that do not follow others blindly, and these consumers show a tendency towards a low FoMO.From the above discussion, it can be inferred that Asian international students, as consumers, reveal different bandwagon consumption behavior based on product categories. Based on FoMO levels and product category, this study can infer that Asian international students exhibit various bandwagon consumption behaviors, and present the following hypotheses, research model (Figure 1):Hypothesis 2 (H2). Groups with higher levels of FoMO have stronger bandwagon consumption on luxury goods than on necessary goods.Hypothesis 3 (H3). Groups with lower levels of FoMO have stronger bandwagon consumption on necessary goods than on luxury goods.
	I removed the unwanted information, such as line numbers, authors list, information about the editor or references list, and gave you the exact text of the original scientific article:Sustainability 2020, 12, 2441Figure 1. Research Model.4. Methodology4.1. Participants and ProcedureIn order to study the consumer bandwagon consumption behavior based on different levels of FoMO and product categories (luxury/necessity), we conducted a survey of visiting Asian international students in Seoul. According to data released by the National Institute for international education, 67% of Korean international students are from China and Vietnam (74% of Asian international students), with most between 18 and 34 years of age. They are emerging as a new consumer class of foreign consumers with increasingly affluent wealth. Firstly, this research adopted the concept of FoMO, which is divided into a high level of FoMO and a low level of FoMO. This makes it possible to assess how consumers show their inclinations towards bandwagon consumption behaviors depending on their levels of FoMO. Secondly, we needed to select the representative brands of luxury and necessity for Asian international students. For luxury, “Sulwhasoo” and “Whoo”, which are highly premium, luxury cosmetic brands among Chinese tourists, were selected. In particular, Sulwhasoo is perceived to be the most premium Korean brand, containing highly valued Korean herbal medicinal ingredients. It has been the most successful premium cosmetics brand in Korea since 2012 and has surpassed the sales of other international brands such as Chanel, Estee Lauder, and SK-II. The prices of these skincare products range from US$150 to US$700 per 50 mL. Compared to other worldwide luxury brands such as Estee Lauder or Lancome, the prices for these Korean brands are similar. Because the brand images and prices of Korean luxury cosmetic brands are competitive with international cosmetics brands, the above Korean brands would be regarded as being luxurious brands for university students. For the necessity category, this research selected the following brands: “Ryeo (shampoo)” and “Aekyung 2080 (toothpaste)”, which range from US$2 to US$8 and are much cheaper than the above luxury brands.4.2. SamplingIn order to determine whether each survey question could be easily understood, a preliminary questionnaire was distributed to approximately 10% of the final sample size (25 Asian international students) who purchased and used the above luxury and necessity brands. The offline survey required Asian international students to answer each question, and this process using quota sampling methodology, was carried out over a 2 week period from 3 October to 16 October in 2019. Following this, a total of 320 questionnaires were handed out and 255 were returned. This research accepted 218 of these returned questionnaires for analysis, but excluded 37 questionnaires as being invalid, after deciding the answers given did not entirely relate to the questions posed.4.3. MeasuresFoMO. For the analysis of this research, all variables were referenced from previous literature. FoMO was measured using 3 items from the study of Przybylski et al. [21]. They are: “I get worried that others might be having more fun than me when I'm not around”; “I often check my phone for messages and updates when I'm with others”; and “I feel left out when others are having fun without me”.
	Here is the text with all unwanted information removed:when I find out my friends are having fun without me.”, “I get anxious when I don’t know the brands popular among my friends.”, and “It is important that I continue to keep in touch with what my friends are doing.” The respondents answered each questionnaire to their level of agreement with each question based on a 5-point Likert scale (1 =not at all true of me, 5 =extremely true of me).The responses were averaged to form a scale (M =3.523, SD =0.874) and indicated adequate reliability (Cronbach’s α=0.878).Bandwagon Consumption Behavior (Luxury /Necessity). Each respondent addressed any bandwagon consumption of luxury brands and necessity brands accordingly . Bandwagon consumption was examined using a method from a previous study, which consists of 3 items with a 5-point Likert scale (1 =not at all true of me, 5 =extremely true of me); “How likely is it that you would purchase /use products worn by most people?”, “How likely is it that you would purchase /use popular products that everyone would approve of?” and “How likely is it that you would purchase /use products recognized by many people?” The responses were averaged to form a scale (Luxury: M =3.529, SD =0.852; Necessity: M =2.824, SD =0.811) and indicated adequate reliability (Luxury: Cronbach’s α=0.879, Necessity: Cronbach’s α=0.849).5. Findings5.1. Sample CharacteristicsThe sample consisted of 48.6% male and 51.4% female respondents. With regards to nationality, Chinese students represented the largest sample contingency (64.7%), followed by Vietnamese students (19.3%). This ratio was similar to the released data of the Institute of International Education in 2018, which indicated that Chinese and Vietnamese students account for 74% of Asian international students in South Korea. Of the other nationalities used, 4.1% were from Japan, 3.2% were from Mongolia, and 8.7% were from other Asian countries. Details are shown in Table 2.Table 2.

Data AnalysisThis research aimed to study and verify the effect of bandwagon consumption for levels of FoMO and product category. The main concept of this research was an two-way ANOVA analysis using 2 (High FoMO /Low FoMO) by 2 (luxury /necessity). To establish more detail on how the level of FoMO with the product category affects bandwagon consumption, quantitative data were collected and FoMO was divided into 2 levels (high FoMO, low FoMO) at the median level. Using SPSS 23.0 software, independent T-test, one-way ANOVA, and two-way ANOVA with estimated marginal means were calculated.5.3. Empirical ResultsBefore analyzing the bandwagon consumption associated with the FoMO level and product category using ANOVA, this research conducted a planned-contrast analysis using an independent T-test.

Based on product category, the mean difference between high FoMO and low FoMO shows 1.427 for luxury and -1.421 for necessity at a 99.9% confidence level (t-value of luxury: 22.456, t-value of necessity: -26.586). This means that between high FoMO and low FoMO, there are significant differences between luxury brands and necessity brands.In order to achieve this paper’s objective, this study firstly adopted an ANOVA using SPSS 23.0 software. Table 4 shows the result of the bandwagon consumption effect of the FoMO level (main effect), product category (main effect), FoMO level * product category (interaction effect) with the mean, mean difference, and significance using one-way ANOVA and two-way ANOVA.Table 4.

On the other hand, with a lower level of FoMO, necessity brands showed a stronger bandwagon consumption level, which was -0.837 of mean difference with a 99.9% significance level. Next, the FoMO level of the main effect showed no significant difference for bandwagon consumption. This means the level of FoMO would not lead to bandwagon consumption. Second, the product category's impact on bandwagon consumption showed a major effect with a 99.9% significance level. Next, looking through the interaction effect, interaction between the FoMO level and product category indicated significant results with a significance level of 99%. Based on the above analysis, H2 and H3 were supported.

DiscussionChinese, Vietnamese, and other Asian international students do subscribe to the bandwagon consumption principle, mainly because they have similar values to those of Koreans (such as Confucian values) and are more easily influenced by the Korean life patterns and ways of thinking. Importantly, Asian international students are influenced by the collectivistic culture, and will exhibit group-oriented consumption inclinations more and prefer bandwagon brands. Thus, based on the above results, this research confirms how Asian international students in Korea reacted to bandwagon consumption behavior in regards to the FoMO phenomenon and product category. Below are the characteristics of each group:• 1. High FoMO and Luxury: Mean and estimated marginal means for high FoMO and luxury are the highest results and indicate a significant influence on bandwagon consumption compared to other consumption behaviors. Higher levels of FoMO would stimulate bandwagon consumption through increased aspirations to join ‘the mainstream in-group’ and purchasing luxury brands representing exclusiveness and a status symbol makes it possible to feel a sense of belonging to a reference group with similar goods. Also, Asian international students, especially from China and Vietnam, have mostly grown up in a relatively wealthy environment, so they have enough resources to enjoy life and purchase popular products with the financial support of their parents. Based on the above consumers' characteristics, Asian international students have exhibited the strongest bandwagon consumption behavior compared to other groups.• 2. High FoMO and Necessity: Mean and estimated marginal means for this group were the third-highest results. In spite of a higher level of FoMO, necessity brands did not show strong bandwagon consumption behavior. This means that Asian international students would not be induced to purchase necessity brands since necessity brands do not stimulate one's psychological stability to stay connected with peers or persons of the main group they want to be associated with. Necessity brands are considered as functional, utilitarian products. In order for Asian international students with a higher level of FoMO to satisfy their needs for belonging to aspirational groups, they prove themselves by purchasing symbolic brands or exhibiting luxury brands. That is why people in this group show weaker bandwagon consumption behavior than those who are in the group with high FoMO and luxury brands.• 3. Low FoMO and Luxury: The mean and estimated marginal means were the lowest for the results of this group. Those with a low FoMO are less willing to belong to a desired and aspired group. Under this psychological state, they do not need to show their status symbol, follow others blindly, or consume goods conspicuously. These people cannot stimulate luxury consumption behavior, since they need to pay more attention to the price, quality, and functional demands of products. Consumers in this group tend to show less conformity consumption behavior. Hence,
	Here is the cleaned-up text of the original scientific article, removing unwanted information such as line numbers, authors list, information about the editor or references list:Sustainability 2020, 12, 2441the needs of purchasing luxury brands would be relatively weaker and lead to the lowest mean of bandwagon consumption behavior compared to all the other consumption behaviors examined in this research.Low FoMO and Necessity: The mean and estimated marginal means were the second-highest and this had a significant influence on bandwagon consumption for this group. Contrasted with the normal assumption that the tendency towards bandwagon consumption is the lowest for this group, Asian international students in this group show the second-highest bandwagon consumption behavioral trend. This indicates those who have a low FoMO are very practical, price-sensitive, and have a risk-free disposition in order to reduce failure probability. Regardless of psychological traits such as belonging to a main group and anxiety of deviation, they, as foreigners and students, seek to be reasonable, risk-aversive consumers within an unfamiliar environment.Based on the above discussion, there are significant differences toward bandwagon consumption based on an individual's level of FoMO and product categories. As expected, the combination of high FoMO and luxury is the highest combination found. This means that many Asian international students in Korea want to be part of the main group in Korea, so under high FoMO, their consumption of luxury products is higher than that of any other group. The next most common category is low FoMO and necessity, followed by high FoMO and necessity, and finally low FoMO and luxury. The second most common category suggests that Asian international students in Korea only purchase necessities for practical purposes.ConclusionsThrough the verification of empirical tests, the implications of this study are summarized below. Firstly, in contrast with previous studies of bandwagon consumption that investigate issues such as social norms and brand characteristics, this study has a psychological basis, as it focuses on the FoMO phenomenon and utilizes it to explain bandwagon consumption relating to Asian international students in South Korea. This is a phenomenon that has been largely unexplained in existing studies. This study investigated the importance of FoMO in consumer behavior in relation to belonging to a desirable group and has presented a case which proposes that consumers display significantly different tendencies depending on their level of FoMO. Hence, the greater the FoMO a consumer feels, the greater their tendency is towards bandwagon consumption. This proposed principle offers an advanced method of research through psychological traits in the field of consumer behavior and marketing.Secondly, this study examines bandwagon consumption through a mixture of varying degrees of FoMO and product characteristics. The findings show that there are significant differences between FoMO (high/low) and product characteristics (luxury/necessity). Those persons with a high level of FoMO tend more towards purchasing luxury rather than necessary goods; on the other hand, those who possess low levels of FoMO tend to purchase more necessary goods over luxury goods. Based on an empirical test on bandwagon consumption, a high level of FoMO with luxury goods was found to be the most common bandwagon consumption behavior among the respondents. Next was individuals that were low in FoMo towards necessary goods, followed by high FoMO towards necessary goods, and last was low in FoMO towards luxury goods. From the perspective of Asian international students, individuals high in FoMO purchase luxury goods due to their symbolic value and to improve their status, hence indicating their aspiration to belong in a desirable main group. Conversely, individuals low in FoMO purchase necessity goods predominantly due to their functional value and to reduce excessive product usage. In conclusion, for consumers with high FoMO towards luxury goods, the dominant norm or standards of a social group to which an individual belongs may drive them to a new style or products in parallel with other group members. Under these circumstances, it may be difficult for an individual to make a purchasing decision independent of the influence of others. So, consumers with this tendency will be more likely to perform more follow-up consumption than those who do not have anxiety towards missing out from social group membership.
	Here is the text of the original scientific article, without unwanted information:Thirdly, this study strongly supports the acculturation theory principle suggesting that consumers adapt to the society in which they live, acquire the lifestyle of those around them, and thus assimilate into other groups, even across borders. In this study, the survey respondents used are Asian international students residing in Korea, and their ages vary between late teens and early thirties. Even though their main purpose for staying in Korea is for studying, they are Korean-like consumers with adopted Korean consumption tendencies, and are especially familiar with the ideology of collectivism.Based on the results of this paper’s conducted research and analysis, this paper presents certain managerial implications as follows: Firstly, practitioners would greatly benefit by using the conceptualization of FoMO for marketing mix purposes and advertising strategies; especially for luxury brands, as FoMO is a useful characteristic to stimulate bandwagon consumption behavior, emphasizing status, symbolism, and the feeling of belonging.Secondly, this research indicates the importance of the consumption trends of Asian international students in Korea, who are mostly from China, Vietnam, and other Asian countries, and belong to the millennial generation. They have a tendency of assimilating culturally, both in groups and within their recognized mainstream identifications. They pay attention to others' behavior, not least because they relate to Confucian culture and collectivism. Marketers need to apply this psychological trait to stimulate consumers to be part of a "main-group". This provides another marketing opportunity for specific groups or generations, especially in Korea, China, and other Eastern Asian countries.Xiahongshu, which is a social media and e-commerce platform in China, provides customizing products as well as services as well as advertising messages for particular groups. It would be strategic to present advertisement messages that are effective for young consumers who have high levels of FoMO. For marketers, it is necessary to establish marketing strategies, and conduct marketing activities directed towards those consumers.Even though this study has made the case discussed above, there are several limitations. Firstly, this study focuses on FoMO as a psychological trait to conduct an evaluation of bandwagon consumption. FoMO is not the only psychological trait likely to explain excessive bandwagon consumption. Future research is necessary to identify other germane psychological traits to investigate which ones are the most influential, when considering culture, domesticity, gender and age, for example.Secondly, in regards to sample bias, the data in this research were collected from a sample of Asian international students staying in Korea, of which over 50% were from China. Chinese students may be more influenced by collectivist culture, exhibit group-oriented consumption, and prefer bandwagon brands more than their European or American counterparts, and hence the culture factor must be kept in mind. Thus, it would be useful for future research to investigate the effect of culture differences on bandwagon consumption, especially on those consumers who are from countries influenced by longer-held traditions, such as England, France, and the USA.Lastly, this research did not discuss the effect of bandwagon consumption from the perspective of social comparison. People tend to compare themselves with others. This would influence psychological motivation of consumers towards bandwagon consumption. For future research, it could be meaningful to discuss consumption behavior using the social comparison theory.In spite of the above limitations, this research contributes to the understanding of excessive bandwagon consumption based on a given psychological trait and product characteristics and, to marketers and practitioners, gives valuable insight into more fully understanding consumers' consumption behavior.

	Here is the cleaned text:Fear of Missing OutFear of missing out (FOMO) was first defined in academic research as “pervasive apprehension that others might be having rewarding experiences from which one is absent, FoMO” (Przybylski, Murayama, Dehaan, & Gladwell, 2013, p. 1841). The authors described FOMO within self-determination theory. That is, FOMO is a motivational driver based on threats to basic human needs for relatedness, autonomy, and competence. However, FOMO may be defined as an affective and cognitive experience based on the perceived discrepancy between individuals’ current and possible experiences.Two underlying types of components play an important role when defining FOMO: (i) affective components and (ii) cognitive components (Browne, Aruguete, McCutcheon, & Medina, 2018). The affective component predominantly describes the emotional experience individuals are having. This affective experience is mostly negative in nature and driven by anxiety, fear, regret, envy, and other negatively-valanced emotions. The cognitive component is comprised of two subcomponents: social comparison and counterfactual thoughts. According to the definition of FOMO above, social comparison describes the perceived discrepancy between individuals’ experiences and those of their immediate and extended social environment. Counterfactual thoughts describe the perceived discrepancy between individuals’ current and possible experiences.The following will first elaborate on the components of FOMO in more depth, then summarize prior research regarding the effects of media on FOMO. Next, effects of FOMO on compulsive and problematic Internet and smartphone use, mental health and well-being, and advertising and marketing strategy will be described. Last, how FOMO develops and manifests throughout the life span will be briefly described.Affective components of FOMODespite the construct’s label (“fear of missing out”) clearly indicating that “fear” is a driving affective component, most prior research describes the affective component of FOMO as a state of anxiety, apprehension, and uneasiness (e.g., Przybylski et al., 2013).
	Here is the cleaned text, removing all unwanted information and artefacts:FEAR OF MISSING OUTexample, individuals who choose to stay at home over going out with friends might encounter an initial fearful reaction to perceived social exclusion through not being part of a social activity and therefore through socially excluding themselves. Consequently, individuals might then experience lingering anxiety by imagining that others might no longer include them. They may worry about losing their social standing by not being part of the group, feel uneasy about possibly not having a good time, and apprehend that their lives are less joyful and exciting than their friends’ lives. According to previous research, FOMO might be a perceived threat to one’s inclusionary status and generate feelings of social exclusion (e.g., Lai, Altavilla, Ronconi, & Aceto, 2016). Thus, FOMO is based on a feeling of uncertainty about possible negative future outcomes closely related to anticipatory regret. In other words, individuals feel that they might have made, are currently making, or will make a wrong choice that will possibly lead to suboptimal outcomes and anticipate regretting the choice later on. Therefore, a haunting residual feeling that the chosen alternative will be less enjoyable than the not-chosen alternative is experienced before, during, and after decisions are being made (Milyavskaya, Saffran, Hope, & Koestner, 2018). Furthermore, not only is an not-chosen alternative perceived as superior to the chosen alternative, but additionally experiences others are having are perceived as superior to the chosen activity. Hence, FOMO is closely related not only to regretful feelings but also to feelings of social envy (Reagle, 2015). This leads to an overall negative affect that is part of the FOMO experience.Cognitive components of FOMOThe cognitive component of FOMO includes internal thought processes, which compare individuals’ lives in two different ways: (i) an individual’s experiences when compared alongside the experiences of others and (ii) an individual’s current experiences when compared with the potential for experiences which are perceived to be superior. Therefore, FOMO is tightly connected to social comparison and counterfactual thinking. In fact, some research states FOMO is a highly social construct that is considered a specific form of envy, regret, or rumination based on mostly social information (e.g., Reagle, 2015). In regard to how individuals compare the situation they are in with situations others are in, they engage in social comparison, which is important for individuals in order to create valid reference points for their self-assessment. In other words, people compare themselves, their situation, and their lives to others in order to evaluate their situations within the context of a group or society (see social comparison theory). These comparisons can be either upward—comparing oneself to someone in a better situation—or downward—comparing oneself to someone in a worse situation. People tend to have a negatively biased view when evaluating their own life and situation against others’, such that individuals tend to see the lives of others as better than their own. This is consistent with findings in FOMO literature (Milyavskaya et al., 2018), in that observing social activities of others increases FOMO within individuals.
	Here is the cleaned-up text without unwanted information:FEAR OF MISSING OUTIndividuals who are in a situation that they possibly could be in, they engage in counterfactual thinking, which is the process of individuals asking themselves, "What could have been?" These processes of generating counterfactual thoughts mostly occur after a decision has been made and some kind of feedback on the chosen alternative is received. For example, when one has chosen to stay at home to do homework instead of going to a bar with friends, one might construct a counterfactual thought in order to assess "what could have been" against "what is." This counterfactual thought might be "I would have had so much fun" and therefore generates a mental simulation of an alternative reality in which the individual would have gone to the bar and enjoyed the night. Individuals might also construct counterfactuals about possible future events, in that they ask themselves, "What could be?" Thus, individuals engage in a process of taking autobiographic events as well as situational clues into account in order to construct a possible future event. Counterfactual thinking, and therefore FOMO, might occur right when the decision of doing homework over going to the bar is made. The counterfactual thought might be "I would have so much fun," and consequently the individual engages in mental simulations about what could possibly happen if they choose to go to the bar instead. These mental simulations about possible future events require substantial cognitive effort and therefore constitute distraction and rumination and bind cognitive capacity.When people experience FOMO, they perceive the current event they are partaking in as less enjoyable and the event they missed out on as more enjoyable. This is specific to alternative events that are social in nature. Yet this is true no matter the type of event that is actually chosen. In other words, even when individuals choose to spend their time with friends at a bar and are asked by a different group of friends to go to another bar instead, they will experience FOMO about missing out on the not chosen event. This finding is confirmed by other researchers (e.g., Rifkin, Cindy, & Kahn, 2015), who claim that individuals who experience FOMO perceive activities and lives of others as more fun and exciting.FOMO and the mediaFOMO has commonly been found to be connected to social media engagement. However, a clear direction of effects is not well understood up to this point. That is, the directionality of whether people who experience higher levels of FOMO more regularly use social media more often or whether individuals who are using social media more regularly experience higher levels of FOMO is not well understood. On the one hand, individuals who experience higher FOMO more regularly might use social media to feel connected. Having a tendency of experiencing apprehension, anxiety, envy, and regret more often as well as engaging more in social comparison and counterfactual thinking might lead to more social media consumption and to different engagement in social media (e.g., more active use or passive use or lurking). On the other hand, social media might provide a new window to experiences that one might not have had otherwise.
	Here is the cleaned text of the scientific article:FEAR OF MISSING OUTwe miss out on and therefore lead to more FOMO. That is, when adopting a social media affordance perspective, social media affords increased visibility of (social)information. This may lead to increased experiences of apprehension, anxiety, envy, and regret as well as social comparison and counterfactual thinking, and therefore to more FOMO.FOMO as being an old concept that is prompted by the media in general. He used the phrase “keeping up with the Joneses” to explain how FOMO has been an important construct to media research for a long time. Thus, he and other researchers (e.g., Milyavskaya et al., 2018) have argued that media use and engagement is not caused by FOMO, but rather that FOMO is caused by repeated and extensive exposure to social cues, of which media offers a transparent but highly filtered picture. This highly transparent and filtered view is not necessarily a characteristic unique to social media. Advertisement and entertainment media offer an idealized view on other people's lives as well (e.g., in reality TV, by using spokespersons and influencers). However, social media extends the experience of FOMO from strangers (e.g., TV characters) to one's immediate social environment.In other words, instead of comparing one's experience to the experiences of a celebrity, actor, or another person whom individuals are not closely related to or familiar with, social media now offers a view into the lives of individuals' friends and peers. Therefore, although FOMO might play a role in both types of comparisons (comparing to strangers versus comparing to friends), the FOMO experience will likely be more severe when comparing oneself to someone who is more similar to oneself. This is based on social norms literature (norms).Most research in FOMO so far focuses on effects of FOMO, which is triggered by experiences friends and peers might have and showcased via social media. Little research has been conducted investigating the roles of reference groups and closeness of the individuals one is comparing oneself to. One study (Browne et al., 2018) found no relationship between FOMO measures and celebrity worship. It is important to note here that this study did not measure the FOMO experience for entertainment content (e.g., reality TV).Popular press and some recent academic research commonly proposes that FOMO is a concept based on the rise of social media, despite its having been around for a long time (Reagle, 2015). In fact, although recent studies revealed that FOMO is not solely a social media phenomenon (Milyavskaya et al., 2018), it is exacerbated by social media and its affordances to gain more insights into other people's lives. For example, seeing pictures posted on social media platforms about things a group of friends are doing might increase the negative feeling one has about being part of that group (Rifkin et al., 2015). That is, social media platforms could exacerbate social comparison behaviors and associated anxiety levels because social media users are exposed to the positive versions of their peers' and friends' lives on a daily basis. The constant monitoring of their friends' activities disrupts their feeling of well-being because social media users are more regularly exposed to missed opportunities in their professional and social lives.
	Here is the extracted text without unwanted information:FEAR OF MISSING OUTEffects of FOMOCompulsive and problematic social media and smartphone useAlthough it was previously argued that (social) media and some of its affordances exacerbate the FOMO experience and its prevalence in our interconnected society, this effect might be recursive. That is, the increased visibility of (social) information afforded by (social) media leads to more intense and more regular experiences of FOMO, but experiencing FOMO, in turn, might then increase the use of social media.This leads to a pathological, problematic, and compulsive use of social media and networking-related technology, such as smartphones (problematic media use: games, phones, and internet). A substantial body of prior research has examined the correlation between compulsive smartphone and social media use and FOMO (e.g., Elhai, Levine, Dvorak, & Hall, 2016). By providing a window to other people's lives, social media is closely connected to social comparison and the need to belong (social comparison theory). Therefore, individuals who experience higher FOMO more regularly are more inclined to monitor their social environment via their smartphone and social media.This social monitoring may or may not develop into compulsive and problematic use. That is, FOMO might lead to the need to stay connected and to stay in the know about what others are doing and what experiences others are having. So much so that FOMO might lead to highly risky behaviors like texting and driving and in general using smartphones while driving. It may also lead to highly antisocial behaviors like phubbing or ignoring interpersonal conversations in order to monitor one's smartphone.This is due to the compulsive need of being aware of other people's lives, which prevents individuals from enjoying current and ongoing social interactions. It may also increase media multitasking (media multitasking) through the compulsion to use one's phone while doing other things like watching TV. Consequently, the fear of missing rewarding experiences that others are having and from which one is absent leads to problematic use of social media and networking-related technologies, in that ruminating on these events and being distracted by counterfactuals interferes with individuals' daily lives, effective functioning, and social relationships (e.g., Swan & Kendall, 2016).Effects on health and well-beingBesides effects on compulsive and problematic social media use, FOMO also has effects on health, well-being, life satisfaction, and some physiological health, which I will discuss next.

Further, FOMO was shown to increase stress and fatigue and negatively affect healthy sleep patterns. In their study, college freshmen experienced FOMO more regularly during the weekends and further occurred more often towards the end of their first semester. Students in this study reported less sleep over the course of the semester, and experienced higher (social) stress. FOMO was not correlated with individuals’ personality traits, such as extraversion, neuroticism, openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. The construct of FOMO is closely related to unwanted and predominantly negative outcomes of psychological and physical health.FOMO in marketing and advertisingThe term FOMO was considered as a potentially powerful marketing and advertising tool.
	Here is the text of the original scientific article, free of unwanted artefacts and information:FEAR OF MISSING OUTIdentified FOMO appeals as a potential tool. With the common practice of influencer marketing on social media platforms like Instagram and Facebook, FOMO appeals seem to be prevalent strategies used. One prior research study has explicated a theoretical framework that describes the use and effectiveness of externally initiated FOMO appeals in marketing and advertising.In his model (Figure 1), he describes that after a FOMO appeal has been initiated externally (e.g., by an advertisement or marketer), the way this appeal is subjectively perceived is influenced by consumers’ personality characteristics, such as need for cognition, as well as situational factors, such as the availability of the product. Consumers then cognitively and affectively respond to the appeal by, for example, assessing source credibility (cognitive) and how a similar prior choice made them feel in the past (affective). These factors affect the actual decision-making process. After a decision has been made, consumers face postdecision responses, such as (dis)satisfaction with the product. This entire process then results in a learning experience that will be used for future encounters of externally initiated FOMO appeals.For example, when a naive advertiser initiates a FOMO appeal, such as "don't miss out, this is once in a lifetime event," a FOMO appeal has been externally initiated. The decision to buy tickets then is dependent on the consumers’ personal characteristics, such as sensation seeking tendency, situational factors, such as social pressure, cognitive responses, such as perceived credibility of the influencer, and affective responses, such as anticipated regret for not buying the ticket. After the decision has been made, individuals experience postdecision affective responses. For example, if the decision to buy a ticket has been made, postdecision affective responses could include regret about spending a lot of money, and postdecision cognitive responses could include reappraisal of predecision cognitive responses. However, when the decision to not buy a ticket has been made instead, individuals might experience postdecision regret and cognitive dissonance. In that, they regret not having bought a ticket and that they will not have a possibly rewarding experience their friends, who bought tickets, will now have instead. This feeling of regret might be accompanied by apprehension and anxiety when individuals imagine what they might be missing out on. Because they might hold a positive attitude toward the festival, but made the decision not to buy a ticket, they experience dissonance (cognitive dissonance) as a result of counterattitudinal behavior. Thus, action, as well as inaction, yields possibly negative affective and cognitive experiences.Hodkinson (2016) also acknowledges that FOMO appeals inflict a severe cognitive load on consumers. That said, FOMO appeals need to be used with caution. The reasons for this are the negative nature of the affective component of experienced FOMO and the increased cognitive effort individuals have to invest when processing these appeals. Thus, FOMO responses seem to be very similar to fear appeals, although the effectiveness of FOMO in advertising has not been studied in depth so far. Feeling of being worse off than others, being socially excluded, and being hyperaware of experiences one misses out on, lead to rumination and negative affect, and consequently might reflect negatively on attitudes toward brands, products, and advertisements (attitudes toward advertisements and brands).
	Here is the cleaned-up text of the scientific article:FEAR OF MISSING OUTFOMO over the life spanThe older people get, the more they become aware of their mortality and begin to realize that they may be “running out of time.” This realization increases their anxiety about possibly missing out on rewarding experiences. This concept is in line with terror management theory. However, FOMO research has predominantly centered on young adults and adolescents. Baby boomers and the 1960s generation have to be included in the discussion, even though their triggers of FOMO might be different due to their greater number of experiences and the stage in life they are at. Broadening the scope of FOMO to include a wider age range takes a new set of experiences and life assessments into account. It is possible that the reasons for experiencing FOMO might be quite different for adolescents as compared to older adults. However, the general processes as described above (FOMO as an affective and cognitive experience) should be the same or similar for both populations. In other words, although missing out on very different things, children, adolescents, young adults, adults, and older adults experience the same set of affective and cognitive responses when they experience FOMO. For example, adolescents and young adults might fear missing out on extravagant festivals and glamorous vacations. Young adults and adults might fear missing out on career opportunities and rewarding financial investments. Older adults might fear missing out on being part of their grandchildren’s lives and seeing more of the world.I removed the following unwanted information:* Line numbers (8, 10)* Authors list* Information about the editor* References list* See Also section* Downloaded from and Terms and Conditions notes at the end
	Here is the cleaned-up text of the scientific article:Fear of Missing Out: Prevalence, Dynamics, and Consequences of Experiencing FOMOFear of missing out (FOMO) is a ubiquitous phenomenon that has been linked to a range of negative outcomes, including decreased well-being, increased stress, and decreased life satisfaction. The present study aimed to investigate the prevalence, dynamics, and consequences of experiencing FOMO.Milyavskaya et al. (2018) found that FOMO is a common experience among adults, with 63% of participants reporting that they experience FOMO at least occasionally. Przybylski et al. (2013) found that FOMO is associated with increased levels of anxiety, depression, and stress, as well as decreased levels of life satisfaction and well-being.Reagle (2015) suggested that FOMO is linked to the desire to maintain a sense of social belonging and to avoid feelings of social exclusion. Rifkin et al. (2015) found that FOMO is associated with increased use of social media, which can exacerbate FOMO by providing a constant stream of updates and alerts.Swan and Kendall (2016) found that FOMO is associated with increased levels of anxiety and decreased levels of functional outcomes. Abel et al. (2016) developed a scale to assess FOMO, and found that it is related to social media use and social anxiety.Beyens et al. (2016) found that FOMO is associated with increased use of Facebook and decreased levels of life satisfaction. Buglass et al. (2017) found that FOMO is associated with increased vulnerability to online risks and decreased levels of well-being.Dhir et al. (2018) found that FOMO is associated with increased levels of online social media fatigue, anxiety, and depression. LaBier (2013) suggested that FOMO can be a significant concern for individuals in midlife, who may feel that they are missing out on important experiences and opportunities.In conclusion, FOMO is a widespread phenomenon that is linked to a range of negative outcomes. Further research is needed to understand the causes and consequences of FOMO, and to develop effective interventions to mitigate its effects.References:Abel, J. P., Buff, C. L., & Burr, S. A. (2016).

	Here is the extracted text without unwanted information:The fear of missing out on cryptocurrency and stock investments: Direct and indirect effects of financial literacy and risk toleranceAbstractThe “Fear of Missing Out” or FoMO has become an accepted motivator of behaviours extending from the purchase of limited-edition sneaker brands to social media use and cryptocurrency investment. As a motivator of individual financial behaviours, such as cryptocurrency and stock investment, it is unclear how FoMO relates to consumer financial literacy and other consumer traits, including risk tolerance and personality. We propose, and assess, a model of reported investment behaviour and investment behaviour intention. We find a larger association between FoMO and crypto ownership, both current and intended, compared with stocks. FoMO has a small association with current stock ownership, relative to the association of financial literacy and risk tolerance. Context matters when measuring FoMO with the more context-specific measures having the largest associations with investment behaviour and investment intentions. Finally, our results suggest financial literacy is an antecedent of FoMO, more so for stocks.Keywords: FoMO; fear of missing out; financial literacy; risk tolerance; gender; cryptocurrency and stock investment1. IntroductionThe fear of missing out (FoMO) has become a widely referenced motivator of cryptocurrency (henceforth crypto) investment. For example, a 2022 New York Times Money feature “Everyone Has Crypto FoMO” highlights the apparently widespread prevalence of FoMO, while the same year’s NFL Superbowl featured several crypto exchange advertisements with “Don’t Miss Out” themes. While this suggests a common understanding of FoMO, consensus is lacking in its conceptualisation and measurement in an investment setting. It is unclear whether FoMO extends to other assets, notably stocks, and how FoMO relates to established predictors of consumers’ investment choices, primarily financial literacy, and risk tolerance. This is the focus of our paper. We propose and evaluate a simple model of crypto and stock investment to investigate the direct effect of FoMO on investment,
	Here is the cleaned text without unwanted information:Whether financial literacy is an antecedent of Fear of Missing Out (FoMO), and whether FoMO has an indirect influence on investment via risk tolerance.FoMO has been defined as the "pervasive apprehension that others might be having rewarding experiences from which one is absent" (Przybylski et al., 2013). FoMO was first proposed to explain the purchase of limited-edition sneaker brands (Herman, 2000) but has predominantly been used to explain (problematic) social media and mobile-phone use (Buglass et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). While most conceptualisations propose FoMO as the motivator of behaviour, Buglass et al. (2017) suggest the behaviour (e.g., social network use) leads to FoMO, while Lo Coco et al. (2020) proposes a bi-directional relationship. FoMO has been associated with other behaviours such as TV viewing (Conlin et al., 2016; Maxwell et al., 2022), broadened to a consumer-centric version linked to missing consumption experiences (Good and Hyman, 2021), and associated with types of consumption (e.g., conformity and conspicuous consumption, Argan et al., 2022).Relative to the already large FoMO literature, research on FoMO in an investment context is small. Available literature suggests higher FoMO among crypto and stock owners versus non-investors (Kim et al., 2020), a mediating role for FoMO on "dark Tetrad" personality traits for crypto attitudes and crypto intentions (Martin et al., 2022), and a positive role of FoMO in initial coin offerings (ICOs) (Karkkainen, 2022). Few papers consider the role of FoMO in stock investing though some consider the role of FoMO in aspects of stock investment or investing generally (Argan et al., 2022; Gupta and Shrivastava, 2021; Narula et al., 2020).Our interest in the role that an individual's own fear of missing out plays in financial asset ownership complements a large empirical literature that has sought to explain why others miss out on participating in risky asset markets. In the case of stocks, non-participation "is likely to be a mistake" (Campbell, 2016), which implies the role of knowledge in investing. Similarly, FoMO implies knowledge of expected investment benefits that may be missed or at least an awareness of the investment option. Either is consistent with the view that perception of missing out is a necessary part of FoMO (Gupta and Sharma, 2021). Financial literacy is a positive predictor of stock market participation (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2014; van Rooij et al., 2011b; Yoong, 2011) and stock portfolio diversification (Abreu and Mendes, 2010; Giofré, 2017; Guiso and Jappelli, 2009; Koh et al., 2020), which suggests that in addition to a direct effect of financial literacy (knowledge) on investment, financial literacy may work indirectly through FoMO to impact investment decisions.For crypto, there is less consensus as to the role of financial literacy with the attention given to crypto described as a "mania" (Smales, 2019) with patterns of prices driven by individual investors suggesting a speculative bubble (Cheah and Fry, 2015), not discouraged by early advice from some central banks to avoid participation in crypto assets (Hackethal et al., 2021). This suggests FoMO may directly predict crypto ownership, independent of financial literacy. However, other crypto characteristics suggest a positive financial literacy role, given diversification benefits (Bouri et al., 2020; Chopra and Mehta, 2022).Modern portfolio theory (MPT) includes emotions, given it "implicitly assumes that human beings dislike high variance, as high variance tends to increase feelings of anxiety or fear" (Uberti et al., 2013). More generally "non-portfolio factors" can be accommodated in MPT as "the expected utility maxim provides a framework of analysis" (Uberti et al., 2013).
	Here is the cleaned text of the scientific article:FoMO has predominantly been studied as a personality trait (Maxwell et al. 2022). Przybylski et al. (2013) identify FoMO as a latent trait, situationally activated when individuals' basic needs are not met (Zhang et al. 2020). Others broaden the construct and distinguish state-FoMO, a specific cognition within the online context, from trait or dispositional-FoMO, reflecting a relatively stable individual characteristic (Wegmann et al. 2017). Zhang et al. (2020) propose FoMO as an emotional response to perceived threats to the self-concept, private (personal) and public (social), and define FoMO as "a fear of missing an experience that can help an individual maintain or enhance their private/public self" (Zhang et al. 2020: 1622). A personal dimension is expected to be more relevant to the investment context, where investing is expected to be linked to the individual benefits the investment provides. Our approach is consistent with treating FoMO as a trait, capturing individuals' disposition to the emotional response of anxiety and apprehension from the perception of missing out on investment benefits. We use a psychometrically validated FoMO scale (Zhang et al. 2020) but, consistent with the approach of Dohmen et al. (2011) when examining risk attitudes, we also explore whether there is "value-added from asking context-specific questions" (Dohmen et al. 2011: 525) by exploring FoMO for specific investments.We are also interested in the role FoMO plays in explaining gender differences in investment, in a similar vein to Jacobsen et al.'s (2014) examination of optimism. To investigate these relationships, we utilise a sample of undergraduate students drawn from a large Australian university. While student samples reduce the ability to generalise results, in the case of crypto young adults are a key demographic. For example, while the average age of Australian investors is 46 years (ASX 2020), estimates for the proportion of those aged 18-34 years owning crypto range from 47 percent (Finder 2022) to 58 percent (ASIC 2022), comparable to the US where 43 percent of 18-29 year-olds have invested in crypto (Perrin 2021). Further, the incidence and effects of FoMO are higher among younger adults (Australian Psychological Society 2015), making the current 18-25-year-old sample of interest.Our contribution is fourfold. First, we provide a comparison of context-free and investment context-specific FoMO scales on the reported current and intended ownership of stock and crypto. While it is argued "theoretically, individuals may fear missing out on any type of consumption experience" [emphasis added] (Zhang et al. 2020, 1631), in the case of stock or crypto investment, the association between these dimensions and the propensity to invest has not been investigated. Our second contribution is estimating the direct and indirect effects of FoMO, and financial literacy as an antecedent to FoMO. This complements emerging literature documenting the demographic characteristics of crypto investors (e.g., Hackethal et al. 2021). Third, we assess whether FoMO can explain gender differences in stock and crypto ownership, and whether there are gender differences in the sensitivity to FoMO.
	Here is the text with all unwanted information removed:For example, the Australian government has commenced a "token stocktake" as part of its consultation on "a framework for industry and regulators, which allows consumers to participate in the market while also better protecting them".To preview our results, we find FoMO has a significant association (medium effect size) with current crypto investment and future stock or crypto investment intentions. Financial literacy and risk tolerance have larger associations than FoMO with current stock ownership, whereas for current crypto ownership, FoMO has a larger association. Financial literacy retains a significant small effect for future stock investment but is not economically meaningful for crypto. We add to our understanding of the role of financial literacy, finding it to be an antecedent of FoMO, more so for stocks. While our evidence supports a role of FoMO on investment via risk tolerance, it is a small effect. FoMO does not appear to explain more than a small amount of previously documented gender differences in financial asset ownership in our sample. Finally, in terms of measurement, context appears to matter when measuring FoMO with more context-specific measures (i.e., stock, or crypto) having the largest associations."Missing-out" or "non-participation" in stock markets is one of several "unambiguous mistakes" consumers make where costs of non-participation are staggering. Stock participation varies markedly across countries. For example, the U.S. direct participation rate is less than half of that in Australia (15 vs 34 percent), though more than a quarter larger than in Germany (15 vs 11 percent). Early estimates suggested smaller differences in crypto ownership rates across countries relative to stock with crypto ownership in the US (8 percent), Europe (nine percent), and 7 percent in Australia. However, crypto ownership rates are increasing rapidly, reflecting a global phenomenon, doubling across a range of countries between 2020 and 2022.Examining FoMO's role adds to a literature that considers emotions and traits in investment and asset pricing. Aside from a direct effect of FoMO on investing, a possible indirect effect of FoMO is via risk tolerance, given "emotions determine tolerance for risk". A distinction can be made between incidental and integral emotions. For example, incidental emotions relating to weather (e.g., Hirshleifer and Shumway 2003 ; Kamstra et al. 2003 , Kramer and Weber 2004).
	Here is the cleaned text, removing all unwanted information:2012), mood (e.g., Hirshleifer et al. 2020), and sentiment (Baker and Wurgler 2006) are found to be linked to asset returns. FoMO can be grouped with integral emotions such as fear (Durand et al. 2011; Drechsler 2013) and excitement and anxiety (Andrade et al. 2015; Hasan et al. 2021).Claims that standard financial theories cannot explain return and price patterns of early cryptocurrencies (i.e., Bitcoin, Kristoufek 2013) led to an interest in psychological mechanisms underpinning crypto trading and trader risks (Oksanen et al. 2022), and personality differences among stock, crypto, and non-investors (Kim et al. 2020).Experimental evidence suggests “the marginal price of securities is set by investors whose personalities ‘attract’ them to traits in those securities.” (Durand et al. 2013: 125). Recent meta-analyses (Highhouse et al. 2022) provide evidence of significant correlation between risk propensity and Big-5 personality traits, similar to results using self-reported investment behaviors (Pinjisakikool 2018) and in trading behavior in an experimental setting (Oehler et al. 2018).Similar associations between FoMO and personality have been investigated with small associations between FoMO and Big-5 personality traits (Rozgonjuk et al. 2021). FoMO sentiment is argued as a motivator for ICOs as perceived scarcity creates an incentive to purchase so as not to miss out on the investment opportunity (Karkkainen 2022). Personality differences are argued to be common across crypto and stock investors, given “higher FoMO scores of investors (Bitcoin and share) compared to those of non-investors indicate that the former are more sensitive to rewarding experiences than the latter” (Kim et al. 2020, 7). Eckel and Ilbrunn (2015) highlight a positive correlation between aggregate Type-A personality scores (and proportion of male traders) and price bubbles in experimental asset markets. Finally, regret (Loomes and Sugden 1982), or at least the fear of regret, is linked to FoMO’s role in purchase likelihood (Good and Hyman 2021), given FoMO is concerned with failures to act (Metz 2019).The role of financial literacy and risk toleranceAs previously noted, financial literacy is a positive predictor of stock market participation and stock portfolio diversification (Lusardi and Mitchell 2014; van Rooij et al. 2011b; Yoong 2011). The evidence for the relationship between financial literacy and crypto participation is less extensive and is inconclusive. For example, a negative relationship is reported between objective financial literacy and crypto ownership (Kim et al. In Press; Zhao and Zhang 2021, U.S. samples), while a positive relationship is reported using subjective financial literacy and crypto ownership (Arias-Oliva et al. 2019; Kim et al. In Press; Zhao and Zhang 2021, in Spanish and U.S. samples, respectively). Cross-country analysis identifies a negative relationship between objective financial literacy and investment, notwithstanding greater crypto awareness (Panos et al. 2021). Heterogeneity is also evident for crypto, with crypto owners without experience in conventional risky assets having significantly lower objective financial literacy than both crypto owners with experience, and non-crypto owners with conventional risky asset experience (Fujiki 2021, Japanese sample).
	Here is the text with unwanted information removed:Financial risk tolerance, or its inverse financial risk aversion, is central to investment decision-making in addition to its role in saving and borrowing choices of individuals and households. Empirical estimates provide the intuitive result that stockholders have higher risk tolerance than non-stockholders. Crypto investors are identified as more risk-tolerant, relatively more risk-seeking, and risk-loving.Gender differences in financial literacy, risk tolerance, and FoMOMen are more likely to participate in stock markets and allocate more to stock. Gender differences in ownership appear more skewed for crypto. In Australia, a 3:2 male-to-female ratio for stocks compares with up to 3:1 for crypto, though less skewed for previous stock investors. The split is more skewed in the U.K. at 4:1, comparable to Japan. Similar differences are indicated in administrative data for crypto-based products. These contrast with 2019 data from Malaysia and the Philippines where male vs. female ownership differences are smaller, and Vietnam where the difference is reversed.The skewed participation profile in stock and crypto investments by gender has drawn considerable attention to the underlying basis of the differences, notably the role of financial literacy and risk tolerance.Lower financial literacy has been proposed as an explanation for lower female stock ownership rates. A combination of low financial literacy and self-confidence explains a large part of the gender gap, while ignorance of expected stock returns is a significant part of gender differences in stock investing.Lower risk tolerance among women has been used to explain lower participation in risky financial markets. For crypto, gender breakdowns are unavailable but overall higher risk tolerance is associated with crypto investors.Evidence of gender difference in FoMO is not consistent with three meta-analyses reporting no moderating role of gender on FoMO and social media use.To summarize, the literature establishes an expectation that FoMO has a positive direct effect on stock and crypto ownership. We expect financial literacy to predict FoMO, and FoMO to have an indirect effect on ownership via higher risk tolerance. We propose gender differences in both the level of FoMO and sensitivity to FoMO account for a significant proportion of gender differences in ownership, controlling for risk tolerance and financial literacy.
	Here is the cleaned-up text of the scientific article:Literacy. We explore whether observed gender differences in FoMO and investing behaviors are substantive, and we extend the literature by investigating whether FoMO explains gender differences, and whether FoMO effects vary by gender. Finally, we expect the role of personality on asset ownership to be mediated by FoMO and risk tolerance.To examine the expectations established in the previous section, we analyze data from a survey of undergraduate students at The University of Western Australia. A link to the online Qualtrics survey was made available through BlackBoard for the week prior to the semester. The final sample comprised STEM (52 percent), Humanities and Social Sciences (HASS, 20 percent), and Commerce majors (28 percent). Approximately 43 percent of the sample enrolled in the personal finance unit elective. The sample is more ethnically diverse than Kim et al. (2020), including 41% Australian/New Zealander, 42% Asian, 7% European/British. The survey was conducted in the last week of July 2021. Crypto and stock prices had risen substantially in the 12 months prior to the survey.Three sets of FoMO scales were estimated and Panel A in Table 1 presents the items for each. The first included the Personal (five-items) and Social (four-items) dimensions proposed by Zhang et al. (2020). Analysis supported the proposed two-factor structure over a single-factor structure. The Cronbach alpha for both dimensions supported that they are reliable measures. The second set included the adapted investment version of the Personal scale (Adapted Personal), which also indicated a reliable scale. Table 1 indicates that the Social and Personal scales had a medium correlation consistent with Zhang et al. (2020). The Adapted Personal scale also had a small to medium correlation with the Personal scale but a small correlation with Social.All respondents were asked “To what extent do you fear missing out on the financial returns on the following investment opportunities if you don't invest in them?” In addition to crypto and stocks, three other assets were also rated: home, gold, and superannuation (retirement savings).

	I've removed the unwanted information and artefacts from the text, leaving you with the exact text of the original scientific article:Asset ownership and retirement savings in Australia, consistent with international evidence, is home ownership (CoreLogic 2022) and retirement savings. Gold is included as a contrast asset which also attracts a lot of attention but is expected to be a small proportion of individual portfolios.Each of the direct measures has a non-significant correlation or does not reach a small correlation size with the Personal or Social scales. Direct Shares had a medium correlation (0.48, CI 0.44 –0.54) with direct Crypto FoMO and a similar correlation with Adapted Personal (0.49, CI 0.43 –0.54 and 0.44, CI 0.38 –0.50, respectively). Adapted Personal had a small correlation with Home (0.23, CI 0.16 –0.30), Gold (0.24, CI 0.17 –0.31), and Super (0.16, CI 0.09 –0.24). Risk tolerance scores (using the five-item scale of Jacobs-Lawson and Hershey (2005), Cronbach alpha 0.80) were significantly higher for males (Hedges g 0.49, CI 0.37 –0.63). Financial literacy was assessed using the 13-item scale of Fernandes et al. (2014) (Kuder-Richardson coefficient of reliability (KR-20) 0.76). The Big-5 personality scores were collected using the 10-item version of Rammstedt (2007) with Spearman –Brown coefficients across the five dimensions averaging 0.44. In the regression estimations in the next section, all predictor variables were standardized.Analysis and resultsAsset ownership and scale summaryMost of the sample have not invested in either shares or crypto (66.2 percent). The smallest group have invested in crypto but not shares (8.6 percent) with 15.1 percent investing in shares but not crypto. Overall, 10.4 percent of respondents have both shares and crypto. Ownership of financial assets is significantly higher among males for both shares (37.3 vs 15.9 percent) and crypto (31.6 vs 7.1 percent).Males also report a higher likelihood (extremely unlikely 1 to extremely likely 5) of future investment in shares (3.87 vs 3.01, 0.49 CI 0.36 –0.62) and crypto (3.01 vs 2.33, Hedges g 0.51 CI 0.38 –0.64).Table 2 indicates that many gender differences identified in the literature are evident in the sample. The mean score on the 13-item financial literacy scale is almost two questions higher for males (7.93 vs 6.13, Hedges g 0.62 CI 0.49 –0.76). Consistent with Bucher-Koenen et al. (2021), some of the differences may be confidence as females had more “Don’t Know” responses (4.17 vs 3.00).Male risk tolerance is significantly higher (3.8 vs 3.2, Hedges g 0.50, CI 0.37 –0.63).Of the three sets of FoMO measures, mean scores are highest for Personal (4.40, range 1 to 7) and lowest for Social (3.43, range 1 to 7). Personal and Social scores are positively correlated with social media use though not as strongly (Personal 0.20 and Social 0.09).

	Here is the cleaned text without unwanted information:as reported in Zhang et al. (2020), in contrast, Direct FoMO Shares score are not significantly related with social media use, and the Crypto score has a small correlation (0.08). Scores for Social and Personal FoMO scales are higher for females, though only significant for Social (Hedge's g0.18, CI 0.05 –0.31). In contrast, Adapted Personal (Hedge's g0.31, CI 0.16 –0.46) and Direct Shares FoMO scores (Hedge's g0.34, CI 0.21 –0.47) are significantly higher for males. Direct Crypto FoMO scores are also significantly higher for males (Hedge's g0.46, CI 0.33 –0.59). Ranking by mean Direct FoMO scores shows gender differences again. For males, the highest score is for Shares, whereas for females, it is Super followed by Home. Males have significantly higher scores for Direct FoMO Shares (Hedges g0.34, CI 0.21 –0.47) and Direct FoMO Crypto (Hedges g0.46, CI 0.33 –0.59).Personal and Social FoMO scales are not significant for shares or crypto ownership. However, both the Adapted Personal scale and the Direct FoMO measures are both significantly positively related to ownership of both assets. When measured unconditionally, the odds ratios suggest a small to medium effect size for FoMO and shares ownership but when other variables are controlled for the effect size is small. The odds ratio of owning shares is 1.277 times (1.289) higher for a one-standard deviation (SD) higher Adapted Personal FoMO (Direct FoMO). For crypto, the effect of FoMO is higher than for shares, but this is sensitive to the choice of FoMO scale. The odds-ratio of ownership is 1.545 times higher based on the Adapted Personal scale or 2.156 times higher using Direct FoMO.We do not have access to a large range of additional student demographics, but of the small number of controls, age (Age), and ownership of a superannuation account (Super A/C) are weakly positively related to shares ownership. However, for crypto, Age is not significant but Super A/C is. Commerce students are significantly more likely to own shares, at least twice the odds of both their fellow HASS and STEM peers. None of the Big-Five personality traits are significant in directly explaining share ownership though those scoring higher on Neuroticism have significantly (weakly) lower odds ratio of owning crypto. A likelihood ratio test of the set of Big-5 variables indicates they do not improve model fit for either asset. The significantly lower ownership rates for females of shares and crypto is robust to the inclusion of additional variables. For shares (and using Direct FoMO, second-last column), the odds ratio of females owning shares is a little more than half that of males, controlling for other variables. For shares ownership, including FoMO does not significantly impact the estimated gender difference (compare last two columns Table 3) contrary to expectations. Using the decomposition method of Breen et al. (2013) to account for non-linear estimation, the reduction in gender effect is approximately 4 percent for shares and is not significant. For crypto, the odds ratio for female is lower again at 0.294 times that of males. Inclusion of FoMO (compare the last two columns of Table 4) significantly reduces the estimated gender effect by 15 percent.Financial literacy and risk tolerance are both positively related to owning both assets. Focusing on FoMO Direct results (last three columns), the odds ratio of owning shares is 1.277 times (1.289) higher for a one-standard deviation (SD) higher Adapted Personal FoMO (Direct FoMO). For crypto, the effect of FoMO is higher than for shares, but this is sensitive to the choice of FoMO scale. The odds-ratio of ownership is 1.545 times higher based on the Adapted Personal scale or 2.156 times higher using Direct FoMO.

	Here is the text of the scientific article with all unwanted information removed:for a one-SD higher FoMO. The indirect effect of FoMO via Risk Tolerance is significant and positive, though small, with the odds ratio 1.180 times higher for a one SD FoMO increase.In addition to a significant direct effect of Financial Literacy on share ownership, there is a small indirect effect via FoMO. The direct effect is odds of ownership 1.930 times higher for a one SD increase in Financial Literacy which exceeds a small effect threshold. The indirect effect of Financial Literacy via increased FoMO is statistically significant (odds ratio 1.074 times higher) but the size does not reach a small effect threshold. In addition, a significant indirect effect of Financial Literacy extends via FoMO through Risk Tolerance but the increase (odds ratio 1.043) is not meaningful. Collectively, the indirect effect is approximately 13 percent of the total effect of Financial Literacy on share ownership.FoMO's association with share ownership is small (odds ratio 1.326 times higher) with an indirect effect via Risk Tolerance similar (odds ratio 1.322).The estimates reported are average effects, but they can change over their distribution. To investigate, odds ratios and marginal effects for the direct effects were estimated at their mean and one and two SDs above and below the mean. The top left panel of Figure 2 indicates that for Shares the marginal effect of FoMO is largely constant across its distribution. No pairwise comparisons of marginal effects along the distribution are significantly different. In contrast, there is a larger change in ownership probability if the increase in Financial Literacy or Risk Tolerance is from a higher base level. For example, starting at a low level (one-SD below the mean) of Financial Literacy (Risk Tolerance), share ownership probability increases by nine (9.5) percentage points if Financial Literacy (Risk Tolerance) increases by one SD. At one SD above the mean, the same increase is associated with a 19 (25) percentage point change in Financial Literacy (Risk Tolerance).CryptoAs with shares, indirect effects are evident for crypto. A small direct effect estimated for Financial Literacy is complemented via an indirect effect through FoMO, though not economically large (crypto ownership odds are 1.070 times higher for an increase in Financial Literacy via FoMO). The indirect effect of Financial Literacy through FoMO and Risk Tolerance to Crypto ownership is also not meaningful. As previously noted, the direct effect of FoMO on crypto ownership is approximately a medium effect with the odds ratio for ownership 2.242 times higher given a one-SD FoMO increase. The indirect effect of FoMO via Risk Tolerance is small. A one SD increase in FoMO has an indirect effect on ownership via Risk Tolerance with the odds ratio 1.145 times higher.The lower left panel of Figure 2 indicates that the role of FoMO is significantly different across its distribution. At a low FoMO level, one SD below the mean, crypto ownership probability increases by approximately six percentage points if FoMO increases by one SD. At one SD above the mean, the same FoMO increase is associated with a 20-percentage point change. Similar non-linearities are evident with Risk Tolerance and Financial Literacy, though more modestly. For example, for Financial Literacy, the comparable effects on crypto ownership change from approximately six percentage points to 10, and for Risk Tolerance from 6 to 11.In summary, FoMO emerges with the strongest association with current crypto ownership, exceeding a small effect size, larger than the role of risk tolerance and financial literacy. In contrast, for shares, FoMO is not economically meaningful relative to the positive direct effect of Financial Literacy.

	Here is the extracted text without unwanted artefacts and information:roles of risk tolerance and financial literacy. When FoMO is accounted for the estimated gender difference in share ownership is not significantly reduced, and for crypto, the reduction is only modest.Moderating effects were investigated for gender and current ownership of the other asset. In both cases, a likelihood ratio test rejects a constrained model of equality of effects. Differences in ownership probability were compared by the group at each point on the distribution. For current share ownership, the gender difference in ownership probability (higher for males) is evident over the range of each variable but increases significantly with risk tolerance. For example, the gender difference widens from 7.3 percentage points at mean levels of risk tolerance to 15.3 percentage points one SD above the mean. For FoMO and financial literacy, the gender gap significantly widens for similar changes, but the economic magnitude is small.FoMO's estimated effect on share ownership is also moderated by ownership of crypto. Those who own crypto have a 14.5 percentage point higher probability of owning shares at a mean level of FoMO, which widens to 17.0 percentage points at a one SD higher FoMO level. A difficulty here is that ownership of crypto is strongly skewed by gender, as 80 percent of those owning crypto are males. Hence, a split by crypto ownership largely reflects gender differences.For crypto, the effect of FoMO is significantly larger for males and for those currently owning shares. For example, at a mean FoMO level, the gender difference in crypto ownership is 14.3 percentage points but at one SD higher FoMO the gap is 20.4 percentage points, and significantly larger again at two SDs above the mean. A gender moderation of the positive effect of Financial Literacy is observed. For example, the 14 percentage point gender difference in predicted crypto ownership at the mean level of Financial Literacy increases to 22.7 percentage points at two-SDs higher.This is largely due to the probability for males increases by 13.0 percentage points over the Financial Literacy increase, whereas for females, the change is 4.2 percentage points.A potential problem with using financial literacy is endogeneity, as while we propose higher financial literacy predicts asset ownership, financial literacy may be higher due to ownership. To investigate, an instrumental variable probit regression is estimated with financial literacy instrumented with a measure of whether the participant had completed a business, accounting, or economics-related course at high school. Variations of this instrument have been used previously. For both shares and crypto, a Wald-test fails to reject exogeneity.
	Here is the cleaned text without unwanted information:report the instrumental results in Online Appendix Table 1, but given the failure to reject exogeneity, we rely on the previous results reported.As with possible endogeneity of financial literacy, the same question can be asked of FoMO: does FoMO change once invested? Consistent with the dominant view of FoMO as a latent trait, FoMO has been primarily treated, theoretically, and empirically, as exogenous. A parallel can be drawn with how risk aversion is typically treated as a generally stable trait in the empirical literature examining stock participation, notwithstanding the possibility that risk aversion may change given the experience of investing.Using a FoMO scale evaluating the stable trait might alleviate endogeneity concerns, whereas using scales adapted to be more state/context specific may not. The direction of any possible change in FoMO is unclear. Investing in a stock or a cryptocurrency may reduce anxiety and apprehension for that specific stock or crypto but leave the predisposition (trait) to feel the anxiety (FoMO) unchanged. Many investors have non-diversified portfolios. For example, in a sample of Australian investors, the median number of stocks and cryptocurrencies is three each, and 36 percent of investors hold only one of either. Hence, for a majority of investors, there are many stocks and cryptocurrencies remaining to fear missing out on, possibly leaving FoMO unchanged. Conversely, new investments may result in greater awareness of other investment opportunities, possibly amplified by the investment platforms promoting further trades, which may increase FoMO. As noted previously, there is no shortage of new offerings promoted by platforms and celebrities targeting potential investors.This possibility, i.e., the behavior begets more FoMO, has been proposed in FoMO-social media literature. Finally, investments are characterized by the asset and time. In the wake of the collapse of FTX, a more context-specific (state) FoMO may have reduced for prospective investors, just as FoMO focused on an event which has passed may wane. Resolving these questions will require further longitudinal work, to establish the temporal stability of FoMO in general, and in an investment context, as well as establish the relationship between FoMO and portfolio development and composition.To investigate whether the relationships for current ownership are reflected in investment intentions, an ordinal logit regression of the likelihood of investing in crypto and shares was estimated using the following variables: [insert variables]. The estimated odds ratio is equivalent to a [insert percentage points] increase in shares ownership probability for a one SD increase in Financial Literacy. The instrumented regression estimate is [insert percentage points], but the effect is no longer significant (p-value [insert p-value]). For ownership of crypto, the estimated odds ratio is equivalent to a [insert percentage points] increase given a one SD increase in Financial Literacy. In the instrumented regression, the estimated marginal effect is [insert percentage points], but the effect is no longer significant (p-value [insert p-value]).Justified by "individual preferences, which should exhibit very limited (if any) variation from adulthood onward" (Gomes and Oksana 2021: 8).
	Here is the text with unwanted information removed:Adapted Personal FoMO and Direct FoMO scores. The estimations presented in Table 6 indicate similar effects as with current ownership. The Big-Five personality traits, Age, Study area, or ownership of superannuation are not significant. Female students are less likely to invest (odds of a more likely response are 0.75 times that of males using the Direct scale), though this is only weakly significant and reflects a small effect.Those enrolled in the personal finance unit are significantly more likely to intend to invest in both assets, potentially reflecting a motivation for unit enrolment. The Direct FoMO scale results in better model fit for both assets, and the estimated FoMO effect is larger and exceeds a medium effect size.For future share ownership, the inclusion of FoMO does not significantly impact the estimated gender difference, similar to current share ownership. However, for crypto, there is a large difference with the inclusion of FoMO reducing the estimated gender difference, using the decomposition method of Breen et al. (2013) to account for non-linear estimation, by an estimated 56 percent (last two columns Table 6).Direct and indirect effects – Future investmentTo enable estimation of the same simple model as for current investment, “Extremely likely” and “Very likely” responses were recoded to one with the remaining responses coded as zero. Recoded this way suggests a high intended share ownership rate (60 percent, 70/52 percent male/female) relative to current adult participation rates, which vary from 34 percent of the adult population to 49 percent.However, it is comparable to reported rates among Gen-Z, considering investing in the future, estimated to be 87/79 percent for males/females. The Direct measures of FoMO are again used in the estimations, and results are reported in Table 7. FoMO has the largest estimated effect, exceeding a medium size effect for shares (0.569, CI 0.471 –0.666) and crypto (0.668, CI 0.566 –0.770).The effect of financial literacy is comparable to that estimated for current ownership. The odds of future shares ownership are 1.899 times higher for a one SD increase in Financial Literacy, which is a small effect (0.354, CI 0.256 –0.452). The same increase in Financial Literacy for crypto results in an odds ratio 1.330 times higher, which does not reach a small effect threshold (0.157, CI 0.060 –0.254). Risk tolerance has a small positive effect for both shares (0.220, CI 0.118 –0.322) and crypto (0.219, CI 0.122 –0.315).Figure 2 presents estimated odds ratios and marginal effects over a range of scores for each variable to investigate non-linearity of effects. For shares (top right panel), while the odds ratio increases over the range of each variable, the significant variation in marginal effects is isolated to FoMO. For example, a change in FoMO from one SD below the mean has a larger marginal effect (22 percentage points) than at one SD higher than the mean (15 percentage points, difference χ²22.60, p-value <0.01). A similar pattern is observed for crypto.

	Here is the text with unwanted information removed:Financial literacy though the change is smaller (12 percentage points increase vs 10 percentage points, difference χ211.63, p-value<0.01). For risk tolerance, estimated marginal effects do not vary significantly. In sum, while the effects of financial literacy and risk tolerance are largely of the same magnitude across their distribution, differences associated with FoMO are larger at low to mean FoMO levels.The lower right panel of Figure 2 suggests a similar variation in FoMO for future crypto investment. Larger effects are estimated at already high levels of FoMO. For example, the marginal effect of an increase in FoMO is 28 percentage points at a level one-SD above the mean versus 11 percentage points at one-SD below the mean (difference χ 249.95, p-value <0.01). None of the variations in estimated marginal effects for financial literacy and risk tolerance are significant. As with current ownership, the indirect effect of financial literacy via FoMO is larger for shares. The increased odds ratio (1.296 times higher) does not exceed a small effect. Indirect effects of FoMO via risk tolerance are not economically meaningful for either shares or crypto.In summary, FoMO has a relatively more significant role in investment intentions for both assets. Risk tolerance is again positively related to a more likely response, and financial literacy is only significant for future shares investment. Notably, FoMO accounts for a large (more than half) of the estimated gender difference for crypto responses.A likelihood ratio test suggests differences in estimates by gender for shares (χ2(23df) 124.6, p-value <0.01) and crypto (χ2(23df) 150.95, p-value <0.01).Table 7.

	I removed the unwanted artefacts and information, including line numbers, authors list, information about the editor or references list. Here is the exact text of the original scientific article:The use of FoMO in crypto exchange advertisements is an example of how institutions expect emotions to play a role in investment decisions. Investment theory, while not discounting the role of emotions or "non-portfolio factors" (Markowitz 1959: 210), assumes individuals' decisions are built on risk-premium expectations, which should result in their participation irrespective of their degree of risk aversion (Campbell 2006). For stocks, lack of participation has focused attention on the role of investor characteristics that establish barriers, notably financial literacy; investor attitudes that predispose against participation, notably risk aversion/tolerance; and demographics, notably gender. Including FoMO builds on work that has established a role for emotions in investment decisions (e.g., Drechsler 2013; Durand et al. 2011; Uberti et al. 2013), and literature examining differences in psychological status and personality between investors and non-investors.On current ownership of each asset also suggested differences for shares (χ2(23df) 209.56, p-value < 0.01) and crypto (χ2(23df) 243.41, p-value < 0.01). To investigate, future investment probabilities were estimated by gender and current ownership of the asset. For future share investment, while the level of risk tolerance, financial literacy, and FoMO is significantly higher for males, there is no significant variation in their effect by gender. However, effects are moderated by whether an individual currently owns shares. The overall effect of FoMO on intention to own shares is larger for those currently owning shares and varies over FoMO. For example, at higher FoMO (one-SD above the mean), the marginal effect is larger for those who do not currently own shares (15.7 percentage points vs 7.0 percentage points, χ2 219.483, p-value < 0.01) whereas at a very low level (two-SDs below mean) the marginal effect is higher for those who currently own shares (25.5 vs 14.1 percentage points, χ2 219.876, p-value < 0.01). The effect of financial literacy is also higher for those owning shares, robust across levels of financial literacy. The effect of risk tolerance on future share ownership is larger for those who currently own shares, driven by larger effects for those not owning shares. That is, for those currently owning shares, increasing risk tolerance does not result in a higher future probability, whereas it does for those who do not own shares.For crypto, gender does not moderate effects on future crypto ownership probability. For those currently owning crypto, there is a significantly higher probability of future investment in crypto. Current ownership of crypto moderates the effect of FoMO on future ownership. The marginal effect of FoMO is significantly larger for those currently owning crypto (24.3 vs 15.6 percentage points, χ2 219.483, p-value < 0.01), indicating that FoMO remains significantly higher given current ownership, and possibly that FoMO doesn't dissipate with ownership. This is consistent with the limited longitudinal evidence of stable FoMO scores over a 4-month period in a sample of Italian college students (Bonfanti et al. 2022) and higher FoMO scores 12 months after initial measurement in a sample of adolescents (12–16 years) (Lo Coco et al. 2020). The larger FoMO effect for current owners is isolated to those with low (one-SD below the mean) or mean FoMO levels. An increase at these levels is associated with a larger increase in future probability for current owners of 13.9 and 22.0 percentage points, respectively.
	Here is the cleaned text of the scientific article:Results are captured by data collection timing as crypto and stock prices had risen substantially over the preceding 12 months, though crypto had also experienced substantial declines in the preceding 3 months. Future work can investigate the robustness of results to older age groups and to different market conditions. Also, our data are cross-sectional, which prevents conclusions of causality and limits our ability to examine endogeneity. Longitudinal FoMO data in an investment context is needed to address this.Consistent with prior evidence, we find significant gender differences in current stock (31 vs 15 percent, males vs females) and crypto investment (31 vs 7 percent, males vs females). While scores on context-free FoMO scales are higher for females, investment-specific FoMO scores are higher for males. While context-free personal and social FoMO scales of Zhang et al. (2020) correlate with behaviors previously investigated (i.e., social media use), they do not correlate with stock and crypto investment. However, an adapted investment version of Zhang et al.'s personal scale does.Single-item direct measures of FoMO (e.g., stocks and crypto) have the strongest correlation with current investment behavior and intentions and using either suggests significant positive direct FoMO effects. Context matters when examining associations between FoMO and investment. While direct FoMO scores are the most informative, a limitation in our analysis is that they were measured with single items. Future work could focus on developing multiple-item direct scales that allow alternative framing, for example, to consider current ownership status.Estimates from a simple model of investment identify a significant role for FoMO along with financial literacy and risk tolerance for current investment and future investment intentions for both stocks and crypto. FoMO effects are largest (medium size) for crypto and for future investment intentions. FoMO effects are the smallest for a current stock investment and do not reach a small effect threshold. Risk tolerance and financial literacy have larger effects than FoMO on current ownership of stocks. While risk tolerance and financial literacy have positive effects for current crypto investment, they are small and smaller than FoMO. Financial literacy retains a significant small effect for future stock investment but not for crypto. The role of personality traits in investment behavior and intentions appears to be accounted for by risk tolerance. Of the Big-5 personality traits, only neuroticism is significantly (weakly negative) related to investment (current crypto), but extraversion (positive) and neuroticism (negative) are significantly related to risk tolerance. A limitation in our analysis is the use of an abbreviated scale (Rammstedt 2007), which may result in noisier Big-5 estimates and contribute to our results.In addition to direct effects, financial literacy has an indirect effect on investment via FoMO, suggesting FoMO has some basis in knowledge though this is a small effect and only robust for stocks. Financial literacy is a significant predictor of FoMO for stocks but only weakly for crypto. A role of FoMO via risk tolerance on investment is supported as FoMO is a significant positive predictor of risk tolerance though it is not economically meaningful.FoMO explains only a small amount of gender difference in current crypto ownership, and it does not significantly explain the observed gender difference for stocks. Gender moderates the effect of risk tolerance on current ownership of stocks as in addition to significantly higher average risk tolerance, marginal effects of risk tolerance is larger for males. For current crypto ownership, FoMO has a larger effect for males and for those with experience investing in stocks. Similarly, FoMO's effect on crypto investment intentions is larger for those who currently own crypto, suggesting FoMO's effect does not dissipate.Finally, our paper is agnostic on whether FoMO is good or bad. FoMO has been investigated primarily within the context of problematic social media use and associated poor health outcomes. Our study does not investigate FoMO consequences beyond impacts on risk tolerance and investment. To the extent non-participation in stock markets is a mistake (Campbell 2016), FoMO might serve a positive role.

However, while the pandemic occurred, the number of capital market investors increased almost three times in 2019. Based on demographic data at the Indonesian Central Securities Depository, students are the second-highest number of investors. This study aims to analyze whether the fear of missing out factor affects student behavior in making stock investment decisions during the Covid-19 pandemic.Introduction:In the economic environment amid the COVID-19 pandemic, investors need to be more careful when making investments, given that stock markets worldwide have experienced a decline on average. In the first quarter, the IHSG experienced a very drastic decline. The emergence of the Covid-19 virus in Indonesia for the first time in March 2020 immediately had a significant impact on the condition of the domestic stock market. The Composite Stock Price Index fell sharply to 3,937.63 on March 24, 2020. The negative sentiment was the impact of the response of investors who carried out massive stock sales following the spread of COVID-19 in Indonesia.This study shows that fear of missing out has a positive and significant relationship with student interest in stocks investment along with return variable, stock prices, and age.Keywords: Investment; Stocks; Students; PandemicJEL Classification: O16; G11
	Here is the text without unwanted information and artefacts:Fear of Missing Out and Student InterestDespite experiencing COVID-19 shocks at the beginning of 2020, the growth of Single Investor Identification (SID), or the number of investors in the capital market, experienced a significant increase until the following year, 56.21% growth in 2020 and 74.15% in 2021 in the third quarter. It means that during the last year’s first quarter pandemic, there was an increase in the number of investors in the capital market to almost three times compared to 2019 before the COVID-19 pandemic. The difficult conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic have increased public awareness of the importance of financial literacy for financial management. The limited activities during the pandemic do not seem to dampen the public's interest to jump in and learning in the capital market.The IHSG was in the range of 4000 at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The decline in stock prices is momentum for potential investors to jump into the capital market, considering that the opportunity to make profits will be much higher in the future by waiting for the stock price to rise again to its regular price. In subsequent developments, the IHSG gradually increased until it reached 6000 and above. Therefore, it is necessary to have accuracy in making investment decisions, both in terms of the type and timing of the investment.Based on demographic data at the Indonesian Central Securities Depository (KSEI), students are the second largest number of employees after employees, with 27.59% of the total individual investors in the capital market. This figure shows early awareness of the importance of financial literacy, which will undoubtedly positively impact future generations. With a capital that is not too large, novice investors such as students can get stocks with good fundamentals at meager prices at the beginning of the stock price crash during the pandemic.This study aims to investigate whether there is a fear of missing out factor that encourages students to invest in stocks during the Covid-19 pandemic. Fear of Missing Out on investment is the behavior of investors dependent on social media. They absorb too much information, so they feel anxious and miss the momentum in making investment decisions. According to Przybylski et al. (2013), FOMO is a person's fear of missing out on social opportunities that encourage that person to consistently connect with others and follow the latest news about everything other people are doing. An investor who has just entered the capital market usually has weak psychology or can be easily provoked by information on social networks. It will affect investors in making hasty decisions without a comprehensive analysis first. Social media provides a space for a person to communicate actively with others and makes it easier for individuals to access new information. The abundance of information about stocks requires investors to be careful in making all decisions so as not just to follow the crowd.
	Here is the extracted text without the unwanted information:Fear of Missing Out and Student InterestThis study takes a case study of students from Universitas Muhammadiyah Yogyakarta, considering that this campus has a proactive student activity unit in terms of stock investment, namely the Capital Market Study Group (KSPM).Several previous studies have discussed investment decisions before the pandemic in the Indonesian context, but none have addressed this behavior after the pandemic. For example, Putri and Rahyuda (2017) examines the effect of financial literacy level and sociodemographic factors on individual investment decision behavior. Respondents in this study were unmarried employees in Denpasar with a sample of 83 people. Data were analyzed using multiple linear regression analysis. The results of this study indicate that the level of financial literacy and gender have a positive effect on the behavior of individual investment decisions.Tandio and Widanaputra (2016) examined the effect of capital market training, return, risk perception, gender, and technological advances on student investment interest. The researcher obtained the research data directly through a questionnaire given to 95 respondents. Primary data, which has a nominal scale, is then converted into quantitative data in the form of intervals using the method of successive intervals. Based on the regression analysis results, capital market training and returns significantly affect investment interest. Meanwhile, the variables of risk perception, gender, and technological progress do not affect investment interest.Pranyoto and Siregar (2015) examines the factors influencing people's interest in investing in the capital market: economic literacy, social relations, attitudes, norms, and self-control. The sample of this research is the people of Lampung who invest in the capital market with 100 respondents. Multiple regression analysis was used to answer the research objectives. The results of this study indicate that financial literacy, social relations, attitudes, norms, and interests have a significant effect on investment, while self-control does not affect investment interest.Pratama et al. (2020) examines the behavioral factors of investors that can influence a person's investment decisions in the form of shares on the Indonesia Stock Exchange. The study data were taken from a survey of 422 retail investors on the Indonesia Stock Exchange, distributed through online media. This research uses quantitative analysis and is based on behavioral financial theories consisting of investor sentiment behavior, overconfident behavior, over/under reaction behavior, herd behavior, and risk perception. The study results indicate that an investor's investment decision in the stock market is strongly influenced by the above behaviors, except for overly confident behavior.In its development, several studies have discussed interest in stocks investment after the pandemic, but the sample categories used are different from this research. Wi and Anggraeni (2020), for example, discusses the influence of trust, financial literacy,

The study uses a quantitative approach with primary data obtained through questionnaires. The sample consists of 166 company employees spread across Tangerang and Jakarta. Data analysis is conducted using multiple regression. The results of the research state that trust, financial literacy, motivation, and return affect the interest of company employees to invest in the capital market.Atmaja and Widoatmodjo (2021) examined the effect of motivation, risk perception, and investment knowledge on investment interest during the Covid-19 pandemic. The study found that investment motivation and knowledge positively affect interest in investing during the pandemic, while risk perception does not significantly affect interest in investing during the pandemic.Research MethodThe study is conducted at Universitas Muhammadiyah Yogyakarta, with the research subjects being students of Universitas Muhammadiyah Yogyakarta who invest in stocks during the Covid-19 pandemic. The sampling technique used is the purposive sampling technique. The number of samples required was determined using the Lemeshow formula, and 100 respondents were obtained.The study data were collected by distributing questionnaires to students at Universitas Muhammadiyah Yogyakarta following the criteria. The questionnaire is a primary data collection tool with a survey method to obtain respondents' opinions. The distribution of the questionnaires was carried out through direct distribution, social media, and asking others for help.This study uses multiple linear regression analysis to determine the relationship between two or more independent variables and the dependent variable. The equation of multiple linear regression is as follows:Y = a + b1X1 + b2X2 + b3X3 + b4X4 + b5X5 + b6X6 + eWhere:* Y = Decision Investation* a = constant* b = Regression coefficient* X1 = Fear of missing out* X2 = Yield* X3 = Price share* X4 = Risk profile* X5 = Friendship environment* X6 = Age* e = error term
	Here is the text with all unwanted information removed:Fear of Missing Out and Student InterestThe dependent variable in this study is investment decision making which is seen when investors start investing, buying and selling decisions, satisfaction with the decisions taken, and the expected results. The investment decision variable is measured using a Likert scale. The final value of the dependent variable is obtained by averaging all components, which is then transformed into a number with an average of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 so that the variable's value can be continuous. The unit of this variable is the standard deviation.The indicators in the questionnaire used to measure the fear of missing out variables are the tendency of investors to follow the buying and selling trend of certain stocks and the behavior of investors who are afraid to lose their momentum in investing in stocks. The fear of missing out variable was measured using a Likert scale. The final value for this variable is obtained by averaging all components in the variable, which is then transformed into a number with an average of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. The unit of this variable is the standard deviation.The return variable uses the indicator of investor satisfaction with the results obtained from investing in stock instruments, the form of return received is in the form of capital gains and dividends. The return variable was measured using a Likert scale. The final value for this variable is obtained by averaging all components in the variable, which is then transformed into a number with an average of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. The unit of this variable is the standard deviation.The indicators used to measure the stock price variable are the low stock prices during the COVID-19 pandemic and the size of the capital needed to invest in stocks. The stock price variable was measured using a Likert scale. The final value for this variable is obtained by averaging all components in the variable, which is then transformed into a number with an average of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. The unit of this variable is the standard deviation.Table 1: Questions in measuring risk aversion1. Suppose you are offered two ways to make money.

	Here is the cleaned-up text of the scientific article:Fear of Missing Out and Student InterestThe risk profile shows an individual's view of the risks faced, especially regarding the risk of investing in specific instruments. This study measured the risk profile using a risk aversion measurement scale. Risk aversion shows the level of risk aversion carried out by individuals on stock investment decisions. Risk aversion is measured by asking several questions with different schemes and risk levels.The value of which depends on the choice of answers to the questions given to each individual. It will then determine the risk profile of the respondent. Based on the risk aversion measurement scheme, there are five categories for determining individual risk profiles. Very high indicates that individuals have the lowest level of risk aversion, whereas individuals with this profile are the most daring in facing risks. Deficient means individuals who have the highest risk aversion. Individuals of this type have the highest prudence in the face of threat. They do not want to experience losses in investing. Moderate indicates a moderate level of risk aversion. Moderately low indicates a relatively low level of risk aversion. Rather high indicates a reasonably high level of risk aversion.Then, the measurement of the risk profile is converted into a scale with a score between 1 to 5. Furthermore, the final value of the risk profile variable is obtained by averaging all components and then converted into a number with an average of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. The unit of this variable is the standard deviation. The scale is determined based on the questions asked to the respondents.The indicator used to measure the friendship environment variable is whether or not the friendship environment influences the decision to invest in stocks as seen from the invitation or motivation caused by the environment. The friendship environment variable was measured using a Likert scale. The final value for this variable is obtained by averaging all components in the variable, which is then transformed into a number with an average of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. The unit of this variable is the standard deviation.Results and DiscussionTable 2 shows the results of multiple regression analysis for the determinants of student interest in investing in stocks during the pandemic. Based on the results of multiple regressions and t-tests that have been carried out, the variable fear of missing out has a positive and significant relationship with student investment decision-making during the COVID-19 pandemic. It shows that the higher the fear of missing out felt by investors, the higher the stock investment decision-making. This finding is in line with Pratama et al. (2020), who found that herd is positively related to investment decisions. This behavior encourages investors to act according to what most other investors do. This phenomenon is due to the uncertainty of the decisions taken by investors.The yield variable positively relates to stock investment decision-making during the COVID-19 pandemic. It shows that any increase in the perception of returns on investing in stocks is associated with an increase in investment decision-making. This finding is in line with Tandio and Widanaputra (2016), which shows that the return variable positively relates to investment decisions.
	Here is the text of the original scientific article, with all unwanted information removed:Fear of Missing Out and Student InterestThe returns from investing in stocks are an attraction for every student to invest. There is investor confidence in the prospect of the capital market in the future being able to provide the expected results. Meanwhile, there is a positive relationship between stock prices and investment decision-making during the COVID-19 pandemic. It shows that the higher the stock price, the higher the investment decision-making.Table 2 Results of Multiple Regression AnalysisVariable  Coefficient  t-count  p-value  Fear of Missing Out  0.152*  1.75  0.083  Yield  0.341***  3.54  0.001  Stock price  0.292***  3.22  0.002  Risk Profile  -0.040  0.49  0.627  Friendship Environment  0.051  0.60  0.550  Age 0.115**  1.93  0.056  constant  -1.06  1.93  0.057  F-statistics  10.19  F-table  2.32  Adjusted R-square  0.357  Observation  100The risk profile variable is unrelated to stock investment decision-making during the COVID-19 pandemic. It shows that a high or low level of risk aversion does not guarantee an increase in investment decision-making. This finding is in line with Wi and Anggraeni (2020), which shows that the risk profile does not affect company employees' interest in investing in the capital market.The friendship environment variable is unrelated to stock investment decision-making during the COVID-19 pandemic. It shows that a friendship environment does not guarantee an increase in investment decision-making. This finding contradicts Pranyoto and Siregar (2015), who found that friendship positively relates to investment interest.Humans as social beings tend to establish friendly relations with others, so the influence of these relationships will likely arise. When a person has an environment where most people are stocks investors, the opportunity to enter the investment world is also more significant.Finally, the age variable has a positive and significant relationship with student investment decision-making during the COVID-19 pandemic. It shows that the older the age, the higher the level of investment decision-making. However, it is different from the results of Putri and Rahyuda (2020), who states that age is not related to investment decisions because the age of respondents who are pretty young, between 18-29 years, tend not to think long term when making investment decisions. This age is primarily a student or a person who has just had a job. At these times, the decision to invest is still not formed because it has not yet achieved financial stability.
	Here is the cleaned-up text of the scientific article:This study found that the variable fear of missing out was positively and significantly related to the behavior of Universitas Muhammadiyah Yogyakarta students in making decisions to invest in stocks during the COVID-19 pandemic. It shows that the higher the fear of missing out felt by investors, the higher the stock investment decision-making. While yield, stock price, and age variables were also positively related to student interest in investing in stocks. It means that the expectation of high yields, continued rising stock prices, and a more mature student age encourage them to invest in stocks. Meanwhile, their risk profile and friendship environment are unrelated to their interest in investing in stocks.Note that I removed the following unwanted information:* Line numbers* Authors' list* Information about the editor* References list* URLs and DOIs (except for one reference that was mentioned inline)* Page breaks and formatting artifactsThe remaining text is the original scientific article, without any alterations to the meaning or phrasing.
